What would the future hold? A soulless hotel with pokies and sports on the TV? Or perhaps private apartments?” he said.</p><p>“Certainly, our staff would lose their jobs, and it would set yet one more precedent in Sydney for the property owner’s right to exert their power over the local venues and hospitality businesses which bring so much character to the area in which they live.”</p><p>The pub is calling on the council to reconsider the restrictions, and is urging the community to rally behind the venue and sign the <a class=body-link href=#>change.org petition, which can be found here</a>.</p><p>The pub has also been raising awareness of its plight on social media, posting on Facebook that “we understand we are not the only hotel in Sydney which continues tostruggle with disproportionate and unfair restrictions imposed by local council as a result of isolated complaints from neighbours,despite the fact that both the council and the NSW government continue to claim that they are supporting the hospitality industry”.</p><p>“We do not have pokies. We do not have televised sport. We have lovely customers. And we always close-up shop at a reasonable hour,” the recent post continues.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community has rallied around The Eveleigh, demanding the council reconsider.</p><p>“It is concerning … that while the majority of the neighbourhood support The Eveleigh and consider it a cornerstone of the community, that the council has chosen to react so strongly to a minority view,” one supporter posted on social media.</p><p>“It seems out of character for a council that is strongly promoting cafe and outdoor dining culture in our area. Perhaps our council leaders should take a moment to check what’s driving this vested interest?</p><p>“You know what really bugs me about this? The Eveleigh is a lovely, welcoming (and very quiet as pubs go) pub that is part of the life of this area,” another wrote.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Much quieter than the f$%#ing council leaf blower that comes around at 6.30am on Monday morning right outside our window! What’s going on City of Sydney Council?”</p><p>“Beautiful music in a great pub, who are these people that live near a pub and expect silence???” another added, while another angry local wrote that there was “always a few ruining it for everyone. Such a shame”.</p><p>News.com.au contacted City of Sydney council for comment.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNoppmctbW5wKucZqaVnrSprs6uqaxlpaOzorXRZqWooaOaeqS7zKmjmqGeqcBuwMernJqslaPAbr%2FUq62irpGherCyjKmmqa2clr9uvNSbZqedp6h6tMDOq7BobJWXr6d9wp5pam9na7KlgI%2BanGpsaGWwo4CScZpxaWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
