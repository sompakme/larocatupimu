As per her website, Moon is a board-certified anesthesiologist who has plenty of brains in addition to her beauty. The "RHOD" star, who graduated at the top of her medical class, now teaches as an Associate Professor of Anesthesiology.&nbsp;</p><p>Since her days on "RHOD," Moon has kept herself busy by being a digital influencer. The doctor boasts over 1.5 million followers on her TikTok channel, where she posts her shopping secrets, spoofs about her work in anesthesiology, and funny reels. Moon, who was a frontline worker during the Coronavirus pandemic, told <a href=#>Insider</a> she didn't join the platform with the intention to share about her profession. "From the start, I didn't want my content to focus on medicine," she shared. "When I came home from the hospital, the last thing I wanted to talk about was work." The anesthesiologist quickly changed her tune, however. "People would comment 'What does an anesthesiologist do' and 'Can you talk more about work,' so I let my audience tell me what they want," she said.</p><p>Moon admitted to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that she felt a weight lifted off her shoulders following the network's decision to put the series on hiatus.&nbsp;"To put yourself in situations where you kind of have to confront people and deal with issues, it was not my style. When they made the decision for us, I was like, 'Hallelujah.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgZX9zgY6wn5qsXam1pr%2FEZp2oqp2av26%2BxJqjZqCfqsCmw8ivnKxln5t6pa3LpZisZZGnsm7Bz2arqGWkpLGixY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
