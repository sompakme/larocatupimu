Danielle Bregoli, also known by her rap name Bhad&nbsp;Bhabie, just celebrated her 16th birthday and unlike other teens her age, Bregoli got a blinged out, custom, diamond encrusted present. According to Bregoli, her two managers Adam Kluger and Dan Roof gifted her with her first Rolex, and they made sure you could see that thing from a mile away.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The teen has always wanted a Rolie but never got around to copping one for herself, and when&nbsp;TMZ caught up with her yesterday,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she showed off</a> her expensive birthday gift for the cameras. According to&nbsp;TMZ, the watch was commissioned by Joel the Jeweler in Los Angeles and is a Mother of Pearl Rolex&nbsp;that features 15.38 carats of VS diamonds around the band. There are another 1.5 carats of VS diamonds on the&nbsp; Roman numerals lining the face dial. That piece of jewelry's estimated cost is around $42,000.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">So what's next for the teenager who has a fat bank account and celebrity status? A car. Bregoli doesn't have her driver's license yet, but she told&nbsp;TMZ that she's taken the "pre-test" online and passed, so she knows how to drive. She also said that once she's on the road, she wants to buy herself a black Lamborghini but she feels as if it's too loud. Bregoli wants to make sure she has a car that won't drown out the music she plans on blasting while she's on the highway. Surely her 16 million Instagram followers can't wait to see photos of that.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
