The company hasn’t had the best luck filling up venues in recent memory, but they are still making adjustments to this week’s show.</p><p><a href=#>AEW brought the best show they could for Dynamite this week</a>. They booked that MJF vs Kenny Omega match during the show. The company also reminded fans of the <a href=#>big match during Rampage</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Wrestle Tix</a> noted that there are 1,031 tickets available for this event. The current setup accommodates 4,177 attendees, and the total number of tickets distributed stands at 3,146, reflecting an increase of 324 tickets since the update from yesterday.</p><p><strong>AEW Presents Collision<br>Sat • Oct 28 • 7:30 PM<br>Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, CT</strong></p><p>Available Tickets => 1,031<br>Current Setup => 4,177<br>Tickets Distributed => 3,146 (+324 since yesterday’s update)</p><p>AEW added a few extra rows in Section 25, prompting an adjustment in the section count for Section 25 and Section 23. The discount code or deal failed to generate a significant increase in ticket sales, leading to the suggestion of removing them and lowering the price point.</p><p>The outlet went on to state that despite the announcement of the MJF and Kenny Omega match, ticket sales did not experience the expected surge, possibly influenced by higher prices compared to Philadelphia. Notably, the three most camera-visible sections in the lower bowl maintained pricing at $86, $125, and $86, respectively. It’s important to mention that this pricing model includes service fees within the ticket price.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, CT has a recorded total capacity of 10,000, but AEW isn’t going to even have half of that available for this week’s Collision. This falls in the line with a growing trend of AEW booking large venues and only setting up a percentage of the space for their show.</p><p>We will have to see how AEW Collision turns out this week. It could be a great show, and they have some good matches booked. Only time will tell how many fans show up, and the final viewership number on television as well.</p><p>What’s your take on AEW Collision? What can they do to really increase ticket sales?
