I’m like, ‘Oh, it’s just Chevy being Chevy,’ and he’s entitled to his opinions and his experience of the show.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actress added that she doesn’t “take it personally.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">WWHL host <a href=# id=auto-tag_andy-cohen data-tag=andy-cohen>Andy Cohen</a> pointed out that the headline “always reads worse than the intention.” Brie agreed, saying, “Definitely. And a headline will be like, ‘Slams!’, ‘Rages Against Community,’ and it’s like ‘What?!’ But it was like two sentences.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Chase <a href=#>shared his thoughts on Community with Maron last September</a>. “Honestly, I felt the show wasn’t funny enough for me, ultimately,” he said at the time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I felt a little bit constrained,” the SNL alum continued. “Everyone had their bits and stuff. I thought they were all good, but it just wasn’t hard-hitting enough for me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While on Watch What Happens Live, Brie also chatted about the <a href=#>upcoming Community movie</a>. Cohen read a fan-submitted question, which asked Brie what she expected for her character Annie’s return. “I hope Annie hasn’t changed too much because I loved her just the way she was,” she answered.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Brie also confirmed that there’s no date set yet for the film to start shooting, but the script is ready. “I read the script and it’s funny,” she teased.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqOiq5%2BjeqO%2ByJ5knKCVq8Zur8eaqp5lk6S6rsHNoquyZWFngHaElmlocWtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
