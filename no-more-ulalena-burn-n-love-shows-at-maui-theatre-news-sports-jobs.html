Burn’n Love, featuring Darren Lee as Elvis in Hawaii, was produced by Michael Kattawar, Preussler said.</p><p>The productions stopped in early May when a lighting company came and removed the lights from the theater because <span class=quotations>“the owner didn’t pay that bill,”</span> Preussler said of Kattawar, who he said was running the theater when the lights were taken out.</p><p>Preussler said Kattawar had been leasing the theater from the Weinberg Foundation. A foundation official could not be reached for comment Friday.</p><p>Both Tokujo, who has an extensive resume in the Hawaii visitor industry and produced hit local shows including the <span class=quotations>“Don Ho Show,”</span> and Kattawar of Tennessee, could also not immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>The ‘Ulalena show had 55 employees, now all laid off, Preussler said, adding that another dozen people were employed with the Burn’n Love show.</p><p>For many, the ‘Ulalena show was a part-time job, Preussler said, although, for a second job, <span class=quotations>“we paid pretty well.”</span></p><p>For around 20 employees, the show was their only job, he said.</p><p>Preussler, too, is looking for work but was still working for free for the show to find a way to <span class=quotations>“get back to work.”</span></p><p>Preussler started on the ‘Ulalena production in January 1999, and then it began performances in July of that year, he said.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s been a long time, almost 20 years,”</span> he said. <span class=quotations>“It’s very sad.”</span></p><p>On the show’s website it reads: <span class=quotations>“Aloha and mahalo for your support! ‘Ulalena is closed at this time.”</span></p><p>The website advises people with reservations to call 856-7900. The website is at www.mauitheatre.com/shows/ulalena/.</p><p>The show was named the <span class=quotations>“Best Cultural Production in Maui”</span> in a Maui News readers’ poll in 2013.</p><p>The production focuses on the island of Maui, its creation, transformation and rebirth. Its performances include more than 100 instruments.</p><p>On Burn’n Love’s website, fans were thanked.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It has been a great four years, and we are grateful and proud of our entire team and those who made the show a success.”</span></p><p>The website said the show has received accolades from TripAdvisor travelers as Maui’s No. 1 show.</p><p>The site also offers a link for those who may have questions, visit burnnlove.com.</p><p>On Burn’n Love star Darren Lee’s Facebook page, he reported on May 11 that his show had ended after a <span class=quotations>“successful”</span> four and a half year run at the Maui Theatre and thanked everyone in the production and fans.</p><p>He said the show is still the highest-rated one in the Hawaiian islands with more than 2,700 five-star reviews on TripAdvisor.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I will continue to perform in Maui and worldwide. Everything was meant to be,”</span> he wrote.</p><p>* Melissa Tanji can be reached at mtanji@mauinews.com.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2XaGdvZ56keq670Z5krqSRobKvrYybrKumnmK5sMLEZqqhp6eoeqLAjKaYrqFdqbWmrdOrnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
