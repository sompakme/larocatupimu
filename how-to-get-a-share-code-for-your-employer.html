You've aced the interview, charmed the socks off the hiring manager, and now it's just a hop, skip, and a <strong>mountain</strong> of documents away from becoming a full-fledged employee.

This awesome person can totally be on our team!"</p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:247><strong>Hold on a sec,</strong> you might be saying, "Isn't that what a driver's license or passport is for?"
