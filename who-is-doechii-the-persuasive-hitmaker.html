The genre-bending rapper self-funded and released her EP, Oh the Places You'll Go, showing the young artist's level of faith in her music. Now receiving more recognition for her unique style, she is rising to prominence in the ever-competitive rap game. Here’s what you need to know about the Doechii!</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-early-life-career>Early Life & Career</h2></span><p>INGLEWOOD, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 01: Doechii attends 2023 Billboard Women In Music at YouTube Theater on March 01, 2023 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Amy Sussman/WireImage,)</p><p>Born Jaylah Ji'mya Hickmon in Tampa, Florida, Doechii’s love and interest in music came early in life. Raised in a creative and supportive household, Doechii’s mother encouraged her to pursue many creative outlets. This included ballet, tap dancing, acting, and cheerleading. The future star also participated in gymnastics as well. The artist was also on track to attend college for classical choral singing during high school.</p><p>During her 11th-grade year, however, Doechii discovered SoundCloud and the D.I.Y. music scene from one of her friends. At this point, Doechii began skipping classes to pursue her new interests in a rap career. During that time, she posted her debut song, “Girls,” under the name IAMDoechii. Years later, she dropped her 2019 project, Coven Music Session, Vol. 1. Afterwards, Doechii faced a stretch of writer’s block, which she would cure by reading Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-breakout-success>Breakout Success</h2></span><p>Doechii would start receiving more recognition from fans, critics, and record labels after the release of her self-funded and released EP, Oh the Places You'll Go. “Yucky Blucky Fruitcake” would be the biggest hit of the EP, going viral on TikTok in 2021. In March 2022, the artist signed deals with Top Dawg Entertainment (<a href=# class=text-word rel>TDE</a>) and Capitol Records. This gave Doechii the bragging rights of being the very first <a href=# rel>female rapper to sign with TDE</a>. Labelmates of Doechii include Schoolboy Q, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jay Rock</a>, and SZA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In the same month, after releasing the hit song “Persuasive," Doechii would also appear as a featured artist on <a href=# class=text-word rel>David Guetta</a>’s “Trampoline,” featuring Afrojack, Missy Elliot, and BIA. Her song, "What It Is (Block Boy)," which features Kodak Black, would also go viral on TikTok. The track samples "Some Cut" and TLC's "No Scrubs." The solo version of the track appeared in over 40,000 videos. The song would help Doechii make her Billboard Hot 100 debut, entering at No. 98. The song peaked at No. 11, showing Doechii’s ability to make moves on the chart.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-style-influence>Style & Influence&nbsp;</h2></span><p>Doechii has cited <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lauryn Hill</a> as major influences on her musical style. Her style is often described as “genre-bending,” incorporating traits from multiple genres, including Alternative Hip Hop, Rock, and Pop. Critics and fans have described the artist as being clever and creative. Known for her hybrid rhymes, the clever lines of the artist catch the listener’s attention off the jump. She can often be heard switching from rapping to singing on her tracks, showing versatility in her talent. Not afraid of the subject matter of her music, her songs explore themes of love, spirituality, and the singer’s raw emotions.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-awards-nominations>Awards & Nominations</h2></span><p>The bold and animated female artist has also received attention from award shows during her budding career. In 2022, Doechii won Best Choreography in a Video at the UK Music Video Awards for her single “Crazy.” The same show also nominated the video for Best Cinematography in a Video and Best Hip Hop/Grime/Rap Video- International. The same year, Doechii was nominated for Best Dance Performance and Best New Artist at the Soul Train Music Awards. She was also nominated for Push Performance of the Year at the 2022 MTV Music Video Awards. The star won the Rising Star Award this year during the 2023 Billboard Women in Music event.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-s-next-for-doechii>What’s Next For Doechii?&nbsp;</h2></span><p>After the success of her singles and EPs, fans anxiously await the versatile artist's official debut. Earlier this year, TDE revealed that an album from Doechii was on the way. The label plans to release the album shortly after releases by artists Reason and&nbsp; Rayvaughn. With singles like the hit "Persuasive," Doechii is ready to prove herself. With fans anticipating her album and critics giving Doechii her flowers, the Tampa-raised artist is prepared to make her impact on the industry!</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIV0gJBmrqGnXZ7AbrDOnpqhoZk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
