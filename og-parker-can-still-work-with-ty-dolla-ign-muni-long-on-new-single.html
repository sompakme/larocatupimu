Moreover, the track is built on hazy and pretty indistinct vocal samples that form a cloudy atmosphere. Unsurprisingly, both R&B singers give impressive vocal performances and captivating melody switch-ups. Furthermore, this track follows singles like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"No Fuss"</a> and "Rain Down" ahead of Parker's next project, Moments. Also, the track's music video employs a nostalgic vibe with a love story to represent the song's longing themes. Overall, it's a fitting track for the Valentine's Day season and one that reaffirms finding love after a long time. Of course, what better way to represent that feeling with two of the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">most dominant current stars</a> in soul?</p><p>PACIFIC PALISADES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 26: Multi-platinum producer OG Parker poses for portrait during his celebrity brunch event on June 26, 2021 in Pacific Palisades, California.

Even with the tracks more sentimental themes, you can let that hang in the background and focus on its soothing energy. Meanwhile, you can let that take a backseat to each singer's lyrics of finding love again after rocky patches. "And the walls feel like they closin' in," Ty sings on the first verse. "It was good but your girls they lead a life of sin / Ayy, if you're hearin' this song / Girl, don't take too long."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, what did you think of OG Parker's latest track, "Still Work" featuring Ty Dolla $ign and Muni Long?

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIFxfJhmpqBloJa%2FrLHRZpqapl2owaq4y2auqKqbYsSqwMdmq7JllKS5ra2Mop6nZZ2qu6p5y6iloGWfo3qvsdZmqqKml6Gy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
