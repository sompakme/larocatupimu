While its pandemic-focused 15th season aired on Tuesdays, the network decided to switch the show back to Fridays, saying in a <a href=#>press release</a>, "The much-anticipated series will return to its original time slot this Fall."</p><p dir=ltr>Season 16 also kicks off much sooner than its previous season did. Season 15 had premiered on November 24, 2020 instead of in September, perhaps due to delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fans have a bit of wait in-between seasons as the last new episode of the series aired back on January 12, 2021. And if it's anything like <a href=#>past seasons</a>, fans can expect Season 16 to have about 13 episodes.</p><p>"Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team" made an announcement that the show would be renewed for a 16th season on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, writing, "It's official! #DCCMakingTheTeam will be back for Season 16 on Friday, September 17th on&nbsp;@CMT." They also included some photos of cheerleaders and the coaches from the show within the post. With all that said, who should we expect to see on the show when it returns in September?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5mbX5ye8Oao6WZo2KwsMPBqLCsZZOdsqa%2By56YnZ2iqHqurcqipaBlpJ2ybsDEmqRmq5WWwLC6jGptZqqVobKiv8Rmm5qslWKwor%2FTZpinnF2dvLh506hksJmkmLVustSlo2adoJ7AsLDErGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
