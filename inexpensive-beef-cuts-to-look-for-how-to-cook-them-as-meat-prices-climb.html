You're not alone—according to butcher and author of <a data-autotrack=false data-link-format=text data-link-region=body data-link-subregion=ecom data-link-type=skimlinks data-promotional=true href=# rel=sponsored>The Everyday Meat Guide</a>, Ray Venezia, "meat prices have never been higher."&nbsp;Why? "It's because the major supply chain issues on both the processing and distribution sides are driving the high costs of the meat."&nbsp;</p><p>So while you can start implementing&nbsp;<a href=#>meat-free</a>&nbsp;Mondays&nbsp;to cut down on costs and up your veggie intake, when you&nbsp;do want to whip up a&nbsp;budget-friendly&nbsp;beef-based dinner, Ray the Butcher has some great tips that will help you stretch a buck and still be able to bring home the beef.&nbsp;</p><p>According to&nbsp;Ray, it's&nbsp;all about knowing which cuts to shop for, as well as&nbsp;how to cook them.&nbsp;Below, he shares&nbsp;3&nbsp;recipe ideas using less expensive cuts of meat.&nbsp;</p><h3>1. Pot Roast&nbsp;</h3><p>"When it comes to a pot roast, what you want to look for is a good piece of boneless chuck which has nice marbling so it's got good, strong flavor. Most of the cuts with pot roast are the tougher cuts, so they're less expensive,"&nbsp;he says.&nbsp;</p><h4>Best Budget-Friendly Cuts of Meat&nbsp;for Pot Roast&nbsp;</h4><p>"I like&nbsp;the&nbsp;boneless chuck," Ray says. "You could&nbsp;also use&nbsp;the&nbsp;bottom round.&nbsp;The rump roast&nbsp;would also work well, or a shoulder roast."&nbsp;</p><h4>How to Cook&nbsp;<a href=#>Pot&nbsp;Roast</a></h4><p>The secret to&nbsp;breaking down&nbsp;these traditionally tougher cuts of meat&nbsp;and making them&nbsp;tender? It's something many of us already have at home, which Ray calls "one of the best items in your kitchen":&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=#>slow-cooker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=speedbump><a href=#>Multi-Cooker 101: What's the Difference Between Slow Cooking and Pressure Cooking?</a></p><p>To make his pot roast, Ray adds the meat to a&nbsp;Dutch oven&nbsp;along with diced carrots, onions and celery, brown sugar, already soaked&nbsp;gingersnaps,&nbsp;a package of&nbsp;Sauerbraten&nbsp;mix&nbsp;(<strong>Editor's pick: </strong>You can order&nbsp;Sauerbraten&nbsp;mix from&nbsp;<a data-autotrack=false data-link-format=text data-link-region=body data-link-subregion=ecom data-link-type=skimlinks data-promotional=true href=# rel=sponsored>Knorr</a> or <a data-autotrack=false data-link-format=text data-link-region=body data-link-subregion=ecom data-link-type=skimlinks data-promotional=true href=# rel=sponsored>Maggi</a> online), a cup of water&nbsp;and&nbsp;a splash of vinegar, then&nbsp;cooks in the oven at 200°F for 6-8 hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Once cooked, Ray uses a spoon to carefully take out the pot roast (you don't want it to come apart, he says), then slices straight down. He likes to&nbsp;arrange the slices of meat over&nbsp;broad noodles, then pour the rest of the contents of the pot over top. "It makes fantastic leftovers,"&nbsp;Ray says.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRY:&nbsp;</strong>For more delicious pot roast recipes, try&nbsp;<a href=#>Rach's&nbsp;Tuscan Pot Roast</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Kimball's&nbsp;Roman Braised Beef with Tomato and&nbsp;Cloves</a> or&nbsp;<a href=#>Emeril Lagasse's Pot Roast Dianne</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Meatloaf&nbsp;</h3><p>"Meatloaf is not only a delicious meal, extremely&nbsp;economical, it's quick and it's one of the biggest comfort foods we have in this country," Ray says.&nbsp;</p><h4>Best Budget-Friendly Meat for Meatloaf&nbsp;</h4><p>Ground meat tends to be inexpensive, according to Ray. You can use ground beef, a mix of ground beef and pork, or a mix of ground beef, pork and veal, he says.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to Cook&nbsp;<a href=#>Meatloaf</a></h4><p>"The most important thing is you never want to over-handle your ground meats, because you take a lot of flavor out if it. And you want to make sure it's seasoned evenly," he continues.&nbsp;</p><p>Ray spreads the ground meat out on a cutting board and seasons with egg, breadcrumbs, parsley, grated cheese and garlic powder.&nbsp;In addition to meatloaf, he also&nbsp;uses this mix for meatballs&nbsp;and&nbsp;stuffed&nbsp;peppers. "You have quite a few different meals that you can make out of&nbsp;very inexpensive ground meat," he says.&nbsp;</p><p>Roast it in the oven at 375°F, and depending on the size of your meatloaf, it will be done in an hour to an hour-and-a-half.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRY:&nbsp;</strong>For more yummy meatloaf meals, try&nbsp;<a href=#>Rach's&nbsp;French Onion Rolled Meatloaf</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Antoni Porowski's&nbsp;Turkey Meatloaf With a Block of Sharp Cheddar Cheese</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=#>Katie Lee Biegel's Turkey Meatloaf</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>3. Beef Stew&nbsp;</h3><p>"Beef stew is a great economical meal. It's&nbsp;one where a little bit of meat goes a long way," Ray says.&nbsp;</p><h4>Best Budget-Friendly Cuts of Meat for Beef Stew&nbsp;</h4><p>Ray likes to use boneless chuck for beef stew as well as pot roasts.&nbsp;</p><h4>How to Cook Beef Stew&nbsp;</h4><p>"One of the most important aspects of beef stew for it to come out great is that the pieces be evenly sized. Get a nice piece of boneless chuck, make sure it's straight on your platter&nbsp;and make even strips out of it,"&nbsp;Ray says.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, throw it into a Crock-Pot or slow cooker with beef broth, a can of crushed tomatoes, carrots and cut up potatoes and let it cook throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><p>"When you come&nbsp;home after work, you'll have a fully-cooked, delicious meal. Good loaf of Italian bread, good bowl of stew, nothing better," Ray says.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TRY:</strong>&nbsp;For more hearty beef stew ideas, try&nbsp;<a href=#>Rach's Beef Stew with Dijon Mustard</a>,&nbsp;her&nbsp;<a href=#>Beef, Bacon, Butternut and Beer Stew</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=#>Donal&nbsp;Skehan's&nbsp;Beef and Guinness Stew</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s63CoZiepKKWxrS0zrBlnKedZK6zwMico56rX567psTPnqWsoaaaeqOxxJ9knK2kqHq1u4ylpqijXZu8s3nHqK5mrJ9isLC7ymaroZ2dYq60ecyemK1loKe2pLHSZpqloZ2X</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
