In order to re-ink your stamp, just remove it from the stand and lay it down on its side. There will be an inkwell hole visible.

In order to use the XpeDater, place a few drops of the matching colour ink in the base of the pen and a few more in the travel cap as required. Holding the teal handle and the white Impression FrameTM firmly together, pull them apart.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Also, how does one go about putting ink inside a stamp?</h3><p>Remove the stamp holder from its position. Using the ink bottle, apply five drops of ink to each of the stamp’s refill holes, starting at the top of the stamp. When applying ink, proceed with utmost caution. Reattach the stamp holder to the stamp. Keep the stamp pointing down for the first few seconds after replenishing the ink until the ink starts to flow from the stamp.</p><p></p><h3>When taking all of this into consideration, how do you replace scanned stamps?</h3><p>Put on your latex gloves and carefully pry the plastic cover off of your stamping machine. Open the AccuStamp refill and squeeze three to four droplets onto the stamp plate, distributing them evenly. Replacing the lid will give you 15 to 20 seconds to allow for the ink to soak completely. Test the stamp on a piece of paper to ensure if it is functional.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>What is an Xstamper, and how does it work?</h3><p>The Xstamper® brand is comprised of pre-inked rubber stamps that do not need the use of a stamp pad to be used. Because of the built-in ink reservoir mechanism, you will be able to stamp clearly and continuously for many years to come. A wide range of Xstamper® products are offered, including the recently created line of ergonomic devices, among other things.</p><p></p><h3>There were 13 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What is the best way to fill a ClassiX Xstamper p12?</h3><p>The only time you should use ClassiX Refill Ink is to re-ink your stamp pad.
