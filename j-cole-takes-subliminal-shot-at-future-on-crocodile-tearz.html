Of course, there is a reference to "Pluto" here which could potentially be a shot at none other than <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, who is on "Like That" with Kendrick.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-j-cole-vs-future>J Cole Vs Future</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> came after <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> on We Don't Trust You. Given Cole's recent allegiance to Drake, it should come as no surprise that he would have a bar for him. That said, there is no telling whether or not Future will want to respond. We Still Don't Trust You is coming out on April 12th, in exactly one week from now. Only time will tell whether or not Future decides to add a verse and respond. Meanwhile, perhaps Kendrick will come in with more lyrical venom. The possibilities are truly endless at this point.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think about this new project from Cole, in the comments section down below.
