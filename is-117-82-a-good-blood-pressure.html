In the top number, prehypertension is defined as blood pressure between 120 and 139, while the bottom number is defined as blood pressure between 80 and 8For example, blood pressure values of 138/82, 128/89, and 130/86 are all considered to be in the prehypertension category.</p><p></p><h3>Also, what is considered normal blood pressure for a person of a certain age?</h3><p>Up to the age of 80, the American College of Cardiology suggests keeping blood pressure below 140/90, while the American Heart Association says blood pressure should be kept below 140/90 until roughly the age of 75, at which time Dr. Aziz recommends that blood pressure be kept below 140/90.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Is a diastolic pressure of 82 too high?</h3><p>Blood pressure that is considered normal is less than 120/80 mm Hg. Minimal increases in diastolic blood pressure (less than 95 mm Hg) do not, by themselves, constitute a substantial danger to one’s health.
