He went on a rant on his Instagram story where he says he got jumped while he was in L.A. He doesn't mention who actually jumped him at first but he did show off the marks he had on his face after the altercation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Before you heard it from anybody else, I got jumped in L.A. by some pussy ass n***** and they jumped me, n****," he said, "Nobody gave me the faith of a one on one, n****. Nobody gave me the respect of a one on one and I painted that n*** while he was on the ground."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He continued his rant saying that someone pulled a gun out on him, his girl and his homeboy before revealing that the Migos ran up on him in L.A.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Fuck the Migos, straight up...

He also says they were afraid to fight him.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Rap n**** be talking about how they killin' n**** and shootin' n**** and this and that but you caught me outside a hotel and bruh ain't shoot shit," he said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">He later went off and named each member individually.</p>"I ain't mad because I got 35 year old niggas trying to fight me.

XXX then clarified that he had no beef with Offset's fiancee <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cardi B</a>, but rather he's a big fan of hers and bumps "Bodak Orange" while in the shower.
