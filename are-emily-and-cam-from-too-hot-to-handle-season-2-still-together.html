The <a href=#>fear of commitment</a> seemed to be an especially daunting prospect, especially for Cam. Despite these growing pains, the couple remained together by the end of the season.</p><p dir=ltr>Amazingly, they've stayed together since the show ended! <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> caught up with the couple on July 5, and the happy pair shared that they're living together and have been since February. They also revealed that they've both met each other's families. "All my family absolutely loves her," Cam said of Emily. Then Emily added that she and Cam's mom get along fabulously and even text everyday.</p><p dir=ltr>Obviously, the pair had to keep their relationship secret for the time between filming and when Season 2 aired. In fact, Emily later posted about this secrecy when she shared a photo on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. "I remember when I couldn't upload this because Cam uploaded it first so it would give away our secret relationship. Those days were cute but times now are much, much better," she wrote. Well, it looks like there was a happily ever after for "Too Hot to Handle"!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5ibYBxe8CrnGadnZ65unnAp5tmm5Gieqe%2BzqZkraefYrWwwIytpmagkaOxrbGMrJyaq5%2BjenN50q2gpaRdqbyosdOhnKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
