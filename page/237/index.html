The Bronx raptress is keeping the momentum going with her latest release, and one of her most creative to-date.

The song discusses the theme of snitching, emphasizing how she and her crew won't participate in snitch activity. The track also was accompanied by a complimenting visual, where she can be seen in various settings. <a href=../../scarlip-delivers-hard-hitting-bars-on-no-statements.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../selena-gomez-wore-comfortable-winter-outfits-on-the-set-of-hulu-s-only-murders-in-the-building.html>Selena Gomez Wore Comfortable Winter Outfits on the Set of Hulu's Only Murders in the Building</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
