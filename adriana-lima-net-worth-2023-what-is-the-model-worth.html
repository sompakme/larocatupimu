But how did she amass such wealth, and what makes her one of the most sought-after models globally? Let's delve into the journey of this Brazilian beauty.</p><p>Born on June 12, 1981, in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, Adriana's early life was marked by challenges. Raised by her mother, Maria, after her father, Nelson, left when she was just six months old, Lima's resilience and determination were evident from a young age. Before her foray into modeling, she even considered becoming a nun or a pediatrician. However, destiny had other plans.</p><p>At the tender age of 15, Adriana clinched the first position in Ford's "Supermodel of Brazil" competition. This victory was a precursor to her second-place finish in the Ford "Supermodel Of The World" competition the following year. These achievements paved the way for her to sign with Elite Model Management in New York City, marking the beginning of <a href=# rel>her illustrious career as a supermodel.</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-rise-of-a-supermodel>The Rise Of A Supermodel</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 13: Model Adriana Lima walks the runway at the 2013 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show at Lexington Avenue Armory on November 13, 2013 in New York City.
