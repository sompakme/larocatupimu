Ancient people loved to throw people down wells, too, so if you've ever felt like our society just doesn't have anything in common with Roman-occupied France, there you go.</p><p>According to Medieval Histories, in early 2014, archaeologists completed their excavation of a 9th-century (ish) Roman village called Intaranum. It was a tidy little village with rows of stone houses and hot and cold water bathing facilities. The baths got their water from wells, one of which was stuffed with the bodies of 20 to 30 different people â€” men, women and children. So if nothing else, that was really gross for the people who used that particular bathing facility.</p><p>The massacre itself isn't remembered, at least not specifically, but based on the time period historians speculate that the bones could have belonged to post-battle pillaging victims, or possibly victims of a band of Vikings, or maybe just victims of a random band of brigands. There's also the possibility that they died during a pestilence, though in that case throwing them down a well where the village gets its bath water is really very extra-gross.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kHBwcmhfl7a7rdGrnGasmJ67qL%2BMn6auppRixKa4y6xm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
