Right place, right time, and right entourage, can all be crucial in elevation or lack thereof. This trade-off between talent and the extenuating factors that govern&nbsp;one's journey to success means that, where some fairly uninspiring prospects have risen to the top, there are many high-caliber voices that have found themselves unable to transfer their potential into a prolific career.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Possessing a near-unparalleled command of language and a breathtaking freestyle game, Baltimore’s Los-- now self-anointed as King Los-- appeared to have all of the raw materials required to etch his name into the pantheon of the greats when he first debuted.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>A student of the genre ever since he found solace in writing rhymes at age 18, the young Carlos Coleman honed his craft with the sort of meticulousness that’s now an afterthought for the overwhelming majority of modern artists. Highly-favoured among hip-hop fans that still covet the art of MC’ing, Los has boomeranged from periods of prominence to obscurity and back again throughout his career, but one universal truth remains-- if hip-hop was a meritocracy based on rhyming, the 40-year-old would be an icon by now.&nbsp;</span></p><p><h2>The Lyrical Mindset</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>As many a battle rapper would attest, lyrical acumen doesn't always translate well into marketability or mainstream exposure; it often takes a lot more than that to make it big. However, Los did not only have the skills, he had the address book and major label budget to match. It's&nbsp;perhaps this fact, that&nbsp;makes Los’ fate all the more bewildering.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Touted as one of the future greats by former label boss Diddy, Los' prestige as a lyricist and artist on the precipice of widespread fame meant that the collabs on his mixtapes surpassed what some rising rappers often get on their debut major label releases.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Having acquired sought-after features from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DMX</a>, Chris Brown, Jazze Pha and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Twista</a> as an independent artist on tapes <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">such as </a></span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>The Crown Ain’t Safe</span></a><span>, the introduction of endless financial resources into the equation made it seem as though success was a foregone conclusion. Saluted by Kendrick as the man who’d provided the most compelling </span><span>response to “Control”&nbsp;</span><span>and lauded as a better lyricist than </span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>Dot by Lupe Fiasco,</span></a><span> all the building blocks&nbsp;appeared to be&nbsp;in place.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But somehow, someway, the stars never aligned for a rapper who could comfortably make devour any beat and deliver profound rhymes with ease. Instead, King Los has had several rebirths that have ultimately led to him occupying the same space in the game for almost his entire career.</p><p><h2><strong>Signing With Diddy's Bad Boy Label Twice</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>King Los first hit Diddy’s radar when he auditioned for the second series of</span><span> Making The Band,</span><span> but then refused to sign the paperwork that’d secure his place. A young Los was signed by Diddy way back in 2006, after the </span><span>Baltimore MC blew the Bad Boy impresario away with a flawless marathon of a freestyle.&nbsp;</span>"I did a 10-minute freestyle that’s actually legendary. It’s been viewed probably a couple million times by this point. I did a 10-minute freestyle and he signed me off of that 10-minute freestyle. This was in 2006," Los&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">revealed</a> back in 2014 when detailing where his first deal with Diddy went sour. "But what happened was, coming from Baltimore, I was surrounded by people that I was doing an indie label with, before the Bad Boy deal, and they were connected to the streets. So by the time I got my record deal, things came full circle and kinda caught up with them and I ended up losing my deal due to some street stuff."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h6>Los freestyles for 10 minutes straight for Diddy</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Suddenly cast out into the cold, Los soon found himself back in Baltimore and received his first taste of the setbacks that can be hurled your way in the rap game. Going from, as </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>he told Ebro in 2014</span></a>, "<span>on the verge of being that dude," back to the lower rungs of the game. Los’ drive proved too unquenchable for him to simply accept his fate and within a few years, he was eventually granted a rare second chance when Diddy came calling again, this time in October of 2012.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Described by Puff as one cog </span><span>in "a whole new movement"</span><span>&nbsp;for the Bad Boy label, alongside labelmates MGK, Red Cafe and French Montana, the release of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">2013’s </a></span><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>Becoming King</span></a><span> mixtape suggested that the coronation was imminent. Composed of all new beats from esteemed producers such as Harry Fraud and Sonny Digital, alongside a plethora of guest stars, the record felt like a real step forward towards the stature that&nbsp;Los had&nbsp;always threatened to assume.</span></p><p><h6><span>King Los with Red Cafe and Diddy at a Miami club, 2012 -&nbsp;Vallery Jean/WireImage/Getty Images<br></span></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Coupled with the acclaim that </span><span>Becoming King </span><span>received, Los’ profile was further developed in that same year by his feature on French Montana’s "Ocho Cinco" and a star-making turn on Kid Ink’s "No Option."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Yet even when it seemed as though he was getting out of the starting blocks, Los was candid about the issues he’d had with impressing his mentor.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>"Puff kind of had an effect on the way I make music, because he is very critical and it made me just want to step my game up," he informed </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"><span>AllHipHop.</span></a><span>&nbsp;"It’s not easy to play a record for him and he be, like, thoroughly impressed.

Losing vital time in an industry where the hourglass is on steroids, and without a major debut album to show for it, Los and Diddy soon severed their ties on a formal level.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Although he was insistent that their split was "amicable" and born of </span><span>refusal to "stagnate,</span>"<span> r</span><span>umours began to surface that his decision to part ways with the label was due to an explosive rant by Diddy.&nbsp;And this rant would soon be adapted&nbsp;by Rick Ross and inserted into the intro of&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Nobody"</a> from 2014’s </span><span>Mastermind.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h6>Rick Ross "Nobody" featuring French Montana</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>"You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These n***s is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme being,"</span><span> an impassioned and irate Diddy proclaimed</span><span>. "You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by. You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop."</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>While&nbsp;Ross would not reveal who the words were aimed at, he did confirm that they were not targeting his "Nobody" guest feature, and another Bad Boy signee, French Montana. "When I took [the rant] and chopped it up and put it on my record I gave him my word. I would never reveal who it was that he was scolding because it's someone you know," Rozay&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">said</a> at the time.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Naturally, speculation began to run rampant, and as the news of Los’ departure&nbsp;broke just one month later,&nbsp;fans started to do the math. Shortly after this idea gained traction, Los headed to RapFixLive and inferred that he may have been the recipient of Diddy’s ire.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>"I love the mystique of this.

"Not to dumb down, but just to have a conversation that everyone can embrace. Because the message is too important. That’s me getting on your level, lyrically melodically, sonically.
