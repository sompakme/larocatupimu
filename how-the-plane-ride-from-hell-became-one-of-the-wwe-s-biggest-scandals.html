Back in 2002, however, the Nature Boy was still stylin' and profilin' like a man half his age, and it certainly showed during the Plane Ride from&nbsp;Hell. On a much more disturbing note, his alleged actions on the infamous flight led to a lawsuit two years later, as flight attendants Taralyn Cappellano and Heidi Doyle accused him of various lascivious acts that included, but were not limited to wearing a wide-open robe with nothing underneath, flashing the women, and sexually assaulting them on repeated occasions&nbsp;(via <a href=#>Grantland</a>). In one egregious example of the latter, Flair purportedly kept Doyle against her will "from leaving the back of the galley&nbsp;of the airplane while he sexually assaulted her."</p><p>As documented by <a href=#>Pro Wrestling Stories</a>, both Credible and Waltman corroborated the story of Flair flashing the attendants, with Credible even claiming that the 16-time world champion yelled his trademark "WOO!" while performing the sordid act.&nbsp;Flair would deny the allegations, while Cappellano and Doyle agreed on an out-of-court settlement with WWE.</p><p>Flair wasn't the only WWE Superstar who was accused of misconduct on the Plane Ride from Hell. According to Grantland, the women also alleged in their lawsuit that Scott Hall (aka Razor Ramon)&nbsp;and Dustin Rhodes (aka Goldust) made sexually suggestive comments toward them during the flight.&nbsp;In a separate incident, Rhodes made things very awkward with his ex-wife Terri, drunkenly serenading her via the plane's PA system until announcer and then-President of Talent Relations Jim Ross told him to cut it out.</p><p>Speaking of things getting cut out ...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCBmHFqbW1fnby4edOhnGaonJa7pnnRopueZZanvK55x56jpWWSmrCiucRmpqedXaSzbsDHnmSwr5WoeqO1xqCcrKxdqLCiusOao6xn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
