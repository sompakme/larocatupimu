She sent out a very coy “I told you so” post, one where she didn’t name anyone, but the timing of it all was unavoidable.</p><p>To those who I spoke in private and ignored it. I told you so.</p><p>To those who called me a liar and told me to jump off a bridge. I told you so.</p><p>To those who once looked me in the eyes and said “I love you” to publicly bash me to protect your bank account. Shame on you.</p><p>Chris Jericho was accused of having skeletons in his closet. There have also allegedly been NDA forms signed, as Nick Hausman called Jericho out for that previously this week, but <a href=#>he was quickly blocked for his post</a>.</p><p>These allegations about Chris Jericho are quite heavy. <a href=#>#FireJericho is now trending on social media</a>, which is the last thing Tony Khan needs on a pay-per-view morning.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We will keep an eye on this story for more updates, because more information is likely to surface.</p><p>December 30, 2023 11:39 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
