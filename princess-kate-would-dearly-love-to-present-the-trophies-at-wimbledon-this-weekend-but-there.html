As she continues to receive treatment for cancer, Wimbledon officials are reportedly putting contingency plans in place if Kate is unable to join them—but more on that in a moment.</p><p>Kate has been patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club since 2016, when Queen Elizabeth personally presented Kate—a longtime athlete and lover of tennis—with the patronage. “Nobody has been more important in transforming Wimbledon’s image from slightly fusty sporting ritual to chic, aspirational, and socially fabulous event than its current patron, Catherine, the Princess of Wales,” The Daily Beast writes. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n6wdaD6aaEgiN7SGLsPZLF-1920-80.jpg><p>A friend of hers told the outlet “It is no secret that she would dearly love to be there, but when you are having chemo, as she herself said, there are good days and bad days,” they said. “A lot depends on the timing of the treatments. She made it to Trooping the Colour, so if she can make Wimbledon, she will.”</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/royals/wimbledon-organizers-are-hopeful-princess-kate-will-attend-despite-largely-stepping-back-from-public-life/>Kate is expected to present the winning trophy</a> to the winner of the women's final on Saturday and the men’s final on Sunday, if she is well enough to do so. But, if that’s not possible, officials have a contingency plan, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tatler.com/article/revealed-wimbledon-backup-plan-kate-middleton-the-tennis-tournament-final referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Tatler</u> </a>reports—if Kate can't be there, “bosses have earmarked the Duchess of Gloucester as a likely candidate to present the Wimbledon trophies if the Princess is unavailable,” the outlet writes. “As discussions continue amidst Kate’s absence, it is understood that informal discussions with the Duchess of Gloucester as a potential replacement have begun.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCFC7tGQADPpLDVfPC72pY-1920-80.jpg><p>A Wimbledon spokesperson told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2024/07/08/wimbledon-princess-wales-backup-plan-finals-presentation/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>Telegraph Sport</u></a> that a “decision had yet to be made,” and that the presentation party would only “be confirmed on the morning of each final.” Days ago, Debbie Jevans—chairman of the All England Club—said that Wimbledon is happy to give Kate “as much flexibility as possible” in the leadup to the final, “including a willingness to delay finding a replacement for the ceremony as Kate continues to work on an adjusted calendar,” Tatler writes.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re hopeful that the Princess of Wales will be able to present the trophies as the Club’s patron, but her health and recovery is the priority,” Jevans told Telegraph Sport. “We don’t know what we don’t know. All we’ve said is that we’ll work with her and give her as much flexibility as possible.” Jevans went on to say in that interview that the Club hadn’t considered yet who might replace Kate at the ceremony, though that seems to have been thought through more since.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aUpoyjt4NhrDPNgqPadska-1920-80.jpg><p>Birgitte, the Duchess of Gloucester, is married to Queen Elizabeth’s first cousin Prince Richard, the Duke of Gloucester. “Like Kate, Birgitte is an avid tennis fan with a related patronage,” <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/kate-middleton-rumored-replacement-wimbledon-trophy-presentations-8674522 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>People</u> </a>reports. “The Duchess of Gloucester has been an Honorary President of the Lawn Tennis Association for 25 years, supporting the governing body for tennis in Great Britain.
