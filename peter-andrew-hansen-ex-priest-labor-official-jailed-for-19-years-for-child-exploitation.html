There was a network but at a limited extent.”</p><p>Hansen studied law before he served as a Catholic priest in the Melbourne Archdiocese between 1996 and 2011.</p><p>He was arrested on arrival into Sydney from Singapore in 2018 and has been in custody ever since.</p><p>Among the more than 100,000 files police discovered on his electronic devices were videos and pictures of young boys lying naked on beds or in bathtubs, sometimes in groups or masturbating.</p><p>Some of the material had been downloaded as early as 2008.</p><p>It was all carefully filed under categories specifying where the material was filmed, what child was shown and acts depicted.</p><p>At a sentencing hearing in February, Hansen told the court he was “ashamed” of himself, saying he had fallen short of his own standards.</p><p>He sat solemnly throughout his two-day sentencing as appeared on screen in court from Goulburn jail wearing glasses and a prison-issue green bomber jacket.</p><p>With time served, Hansen will be eligible for parole in October 2032.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGSwsMHRrapmpJGsfLGx056pZpmemb%2Bmw4yhmKerlaN6psTPq6Ceq6RiuaKuzqtkqJ6WnrCqrctmoZqhnJqxbrLOq2RqcV2usqK%2B0madqKpdmLWquMNmnLGonKS2ta3ToqanZ56axLR50q2mq7FfaH15spNunZqcY5l%2Fcn6Ym2tvnGJsf3atkG%2BZbXCWbII%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
