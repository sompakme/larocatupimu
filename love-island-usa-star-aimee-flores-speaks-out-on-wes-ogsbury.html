However, it seems they are back together again — if they even broke up at all.</p><p>Aimee has re-followed Wes on Instagram. She also added all their photos back to her account.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On top of that, Aimee took to her IG Stories and posted something to confirm that she is still with Wes.</p><p>In the post, she said that she was having dinner with Wes and his family. She also had a couple of videos that showed Wes at some event that included a toast being given.</p><p>It was clear that something happened between Aimee and Wes, but it is possible that it was either a misunderstanding or it was something that the two worked out because Aimee is acting like nothing was ever wrong to begin with and it is all back to normal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aimee and Wes are still together, unlike other Love Island couples</h2><p>Aimee and Wes left the villa early and lost the chance to be the winning couple on Love Island USA.</p><p>Out of the four couples that made it to the finale, only one is as strong as Aimee and Wes appeared.</p><p><a href=#>Will and Kyra are still together</a>, and they seem like one of the best connections outside of <a href=#>Shannon and Josh</a>, who left early when <a href=#>Josh’s sister died</a>.</p><p>Another finals couple broke up instantly when <a href=#>Charlie and Alana proved they were not going to make it</a> outside the villa.</p><p><a href=#>Jeremy and Bailey were a huge fan favorite</a> after the show ended but he has since told her that he liked someone else outside the villa and broke things off.</p><p>There is still no word on how serious <a href=#>winners Olivia and Korey</a> are.</p><p>Love Island USA is on hiatus. Catch up with all the love connections from Season 3 on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUYsK0rYysq5qqXZa2rrHEZp2lp6KawG6%2Fz56YpKtdpMK1ec6nZLCdo2K8qL%2FBrqmyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
