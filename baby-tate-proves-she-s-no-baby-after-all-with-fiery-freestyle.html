The hard-hitting, versatile rapper is capable of playing it effortlessly casual or dialing it in and popping off on her adversaries. Just last week <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she stopped by On The Radar for a performance</a> in the now iconic green room. While there she showed love to numerous female rappers and singers who paved the way for her like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rihanna</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Missy Elliott</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But in her newest freestyle performance, Baby Tate is all about herself. She shared the hard-hitting new freestyle to Instagram earlier this week and fans have been eating it up. In her performance she recontextualizes her name, assuring everyone that while she's called Baby, she isn't a kid. She also assures any rapper trying to act like her mother that she "barely calls them sis." She did it all while recording from what appears to be her bedroom with a pretty basic set-up. Check out the video of her newest freestyle below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-baby-tate-unleashes-hard-hitting-new-freestyle>Baby Tate Unleashes Hard-Hitting New Freestyle</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Baby Tate is featured on a song that was at the center of a viral challenge last year. She teamed up with JID and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>21 Savage</a> for the track "Surround Sound" from JID's 2022 album The Forever Story. While the song was an instant fan-favorite it didn't reach its peak of success until more than a year later. That came because it served as the soundtrack for a TikTok challenge that shot it up the charts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since then <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Surround Sound" has gone platinum</a> and racked up nearly 500 million streams on Spotify alone. It's currently Baby Tate's most-streamed song on the platform outpacing tracks like "STUPID" and "Hey, Mickey!" What do you think of Baby Tate's new freestyle? Do you think she did a good job proving that the Baby in her name isn't indicative of her style or talent?
