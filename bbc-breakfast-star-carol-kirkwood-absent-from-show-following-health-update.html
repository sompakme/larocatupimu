"If you're missing @carolkirkwood this week, here's a forecast she prepared earlier* *Much earlier," they penned, while another asked: "Where [have you] been all these days Carol?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cb58ff99b89b-carol-kirkwood.jpg><p id=eMvm0Q7SRom data-wc=75>The presenter's absence comes just a week after she revealed she was suffering from a "croaky" voice. Last Tuesday, Carol persevered through the programme despite suffering from a sore throat and was praised by her co-star <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Sally Nugent</a>. "Carol, I know you'll be keeping an eye on that [Storm Kathleen], and <strong>well done - we've got to the end of Breakfast and your voice has survived. </strong>It's an achievement. Go and rest," said the host.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJbo0pPIG_T data-wc=11>Carol responded: "I hope it hangs on for tomorrow as well."</p><p id=eKRQLm8kY1c data-wc=19>Jon then asked for the forecast, to which Carol quipped: "For my voice, Jon?

Steve started fidgeting; I turned to say: 'What's wrong?' He was on his knee, and he proposed. At first, I thought he was joking, but he said: <strong>'No no, I really do mean it, Will you marry me?</strong>' I said: 'Yes!!
