Soon Lexie finds herself walking a treacherous tightrope between Cal and the police in which her safety, and even her life, are in grave danger."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Meet the cast of ITV's Payback</h2><h3 dir=ltr>Morven Christie</h3><p id=e7iilX9_ZXd data-wc=60>Morven Christie is no stranger to television. Famed for her portrayal of Amanda Hopkins in <a class=hm-link href=#>Grantchester</a> (2014-17), and DS Lisa Armstrong in The Bay (2019-21), the Scottish actress has worked with ITV on a number of occasions. More recently, fans may also have spotted Morven in Netflix's supernatural detective thriller, Lockwood & Co. (2023) in which she played Penelope Fittes.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1a23a21ea16f-morven-christie-payback.jpg><p id=e4ChqC-CltB data-wc=62>Speaking about the character of Lexie in Payback, Morven said: "In this family that she's built with Jared she has this idealistic, beautiful, loving home life, but outside of that she's really quite closed-off to the world. She doesn't really trust people, so when this starts to happen at the beginning of the show she plummets back into this survivalist, trust-no-one mode.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep77lTVP0Cr data-wc=29>"She's quite a difficult person for Jared's friends to jump in and look after because she doesn't want help. She doesn't want to be looked after. She's really self-reliant."</p><p id=eiK95xVlms6 data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>ITV's The Long Shadow: Who plays Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe and what has he been in before?</a></p><p id=etNmIJ3Fet data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Happy Valley stars reunite for new ITV thriller – and it sounds brilliant</a></p><h3 dir=ltr>Peter Mullan&nbsp;</h3><p id=eq_wdx2u2jH data-wc=33>Actor and filmmaker Peter Mullan has starred in a number of cult classic movies, including Braveheart (1995), Trainspotting (1996), Young Adam (2003), the final two Harry Potter films (2010–11), and War Horse (2011).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62fb92742145-peter-mullan-in-payback.jpg><p id=e31FZAbdLKY data-wc=49>Boasting an equally impressive list of TV credits, you may recognize Peter from Top of the Lake (2013), Ozark (2017-18), Westworld (2018-20) and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (2022). A pro at playing the villain, Payback will see Peter as notorious crime lord, Cal Morris.</p><h3 dir=ltr>Prasanna Puwanarajah</h3><p id=ejGbiLkG80bz data-wc=65>Prasanna Puwanarajah is taking the TV world by storm. After landing roles in hit series like Doctor Foster (2017), Patrick Melrose (2018), World on Fire (2019), and Line of Duty&nbsp;(2021), the actor lent his talents to The Crown's fifth season last year. Appearing as Martin Bashir, the former British journalist who conducted the infamous Panorama interview with Princess Diana, Prasanna certainly made an impression.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1404f2dc37cc-prasanna-puwanarajah-payback.jpg><p id=exOlrIC0W9Ox data-wc=39>Now, he's stepping into the shoes of DC Jibran Khan, a financial investigator in the Scottish police force. Determined to bring down criminal Cal Morris, Jibran and his colleague, DCI Adam Guthrie, have a tough case on their hands.&nbsp;</p><h3 dir=ltr>Derek Riddell as DCI Adam Guthrie</h3><p id=eOGIVQCkpawl data-wc=44>It's our Catherine's ex, David Cawood, from Happy Valley! While actor Derek Riddell is typically recognized for his role in the hit police drama, he's also appeared in Hard Sun (2018), Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018), Gentleman Jack (2019) and Shetland (2019).&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae5793a88323-derek-riddell-in-payback.jpg><p id=eVDAXo2xygt7 data-wc=50>This time round, he'll be playing DCI Adam Guthrie, a detective chief inspector in the financial branch of the force. Offering some insight into the character, Derek told ITV: "I would say he's a slightly old-school detective and he is viewed in that way by some of his younger colleagues.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDk5rEdiNmCL data-wc=65>"He finds having to go after Cal Morris a bit tedious, having to get him through financial means rather than just normal policing. I think he finds the use of technology and delving into this guy's financial dealings a bit tiresome. But he realises that this is the way that he's going to capture this guy that he's been after for a long, long time."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ2xwY2p8qsDVZquhqpmhuaa%2BjKmYspqRmLhuucSeq2asmJp6pK3SrWSippOhwqW1zaBkoZmgpcZuwsClo56xXZa7pXnGq5inrJOdsrTAxKtkmpukpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
