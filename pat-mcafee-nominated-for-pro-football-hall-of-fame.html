He was recently in Denver, and that was a smashing success, thanks to <a href=#>The Rock showing up to put the whole things</a> into another level. Of course, McAfee first broke in to the public space as a football punter, and now those accomplishments are being recognized in a big way.</p><p>Pat McAfee has been nominated for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2024, as announced by <a href=#>NFL.com</a> and various other sources. The Pro Football Hall of Fame revealed the list of nominees for Modern-Era players eligible for election, requiring a minimum of five full seasons played and at least five years of retirement.</p><p>This initial group of 173 nominees is just the first selection phase, with a semifinal group of 25 players set to be announced in November. Subsequently, the next group will consist of 10 to 15 nominees, with the selection committee voting on five finalists and considering senior finalists as well.</p><p>Pat McAfee is one of the nominees for the punter position, alongside other former punters Darren Bennett, Jeff Feagles, Sean Landeta, Shane Lechler, Brad Maynard, Pat McAfee, Brian Moorman, and Matt Turk.</p><p>The Indianapolis Colts drafted McAfee in the seventh round of the 2009 NFL Draft, and he played during the team’s Super Bowl appearance in his rookie season. Retiring in 2017, McAfee earned First-Team All-Pro honors and was selected to the Pro Bowl twice during his career.</p><p>In recent years, Pat McAfee has found success as the host of his show, the Pat McAfee Show, and ventured into sports entertainment, briefly appearing in NXT before joining the SmackDown commentary team. McAfee participated in WrestleMania 38 and SummerSlam 2022, with his announcing responsibilities temporarily on hold during his tenure with ESPN College GameDay starting in September 2022. McAfee made surprise returns at WWE Royal Rumble 2023, WrestleMania 39, and the September 15 episode of WWE SmackDown.</p><p>We will have to see if Pat McAfee gets enough votes to find himself in the Hall of Fame, but just being a part of the conversation has to be an honor. Pat McAfee also might expect a WWE Hall of Fame induction later on, if he keeps up those amazing experiences.</p><p>What’s your take on this situation with Pat McAfee in the Pro Football Hall of Fame?
