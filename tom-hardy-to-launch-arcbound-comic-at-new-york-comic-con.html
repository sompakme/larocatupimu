Hardy has taken on the title of creative collaborator, with the actor focusing on character development for the broader Arcbound universe.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As part of the rollout for the book, Hardy and the creative team will appear for a signing Saturday at <a href=# id=auto-tag_new-york-comic-con data-tag=new-york-comic-con>New York Comic Con</a> from &nbsp;4:45 p.m. – 5:30 p.m. at the Arcbound booth (#3063). Meanwhile, members of the creative team, not including Hardy, will host a panel Saturday from 3 p.m. – 4 p.m. in room #409.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 12-issue series takes place in a future where Earth is a barren wasteland. According to the official description, “The formidable corporatocracy, Zynitec, harnesses the unmatched energy of Kronium to assert its dominion across the stars. The Arcbound series chronicles the journey of Kai, a resolute Mediator Captain, tasked with maintaining Zynitec’s lifeline to Kronium. However, as he grapples with the morality of his role, revelations about Zynitec’s dubious past thrust him into a poignant quandary: to remain loyal to the empire or to confront the forces that molded him into a tool of oppression.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Issue No. 1 arrives in March, but an Ashcan edition will be at New York Comic Con at the Arcbound Booth starting Thursday. The Arcbound team also includes veteran scribe Frank Tieri,&nbsp;known for Wolverine and Deadpool, and artist&nbsp;Ryan Smallman, who has worked on Fortnite and Marvel titles. Artists contributing variant covers include Ryan Ottley, Clay Mann, Tyler Kirkham and Dan Panosian.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Arcbound is set apart not just by its original concept and narrative, but also by the team that’s breathing life into it. Frank is one of the best storytellers I know. His imaginative talent is amazing, but he’s also an incredible structuralist. Ryan’s style is so kinetic, so full of energy and passion. And Tom has been responsible for bringing some of my favorite characters to life on the screen – he’s a true creative force,” said Snyder in a statement. “So, having the chance to work with all three of them in building a world and story of this scope…it’s hugely exciting. Because Arcbound is not just a comic; it’s a narrative expression reflecting our times.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Hardy has experience on the creative side of the film business, earning writing credits on Venom: Let There Be Carnage and the upcoming third Venom movie. He has been a frequent collaborator of Christopher Nolan, starring in Inception, The Dark Knight Rises and Dunkirk, and became an Oscar-nominee for The Revenant. He has the feature The Bikeriders due out Dec. 1.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’ve always been drawn to the creative process in all aspects of storytelling – and with comics, I find it’s a fascinating playground to explore. A place where as long as you have a great creative team and the ability to illustrate, write, and discuss – you can build epic worlds together. Worlds you have the distinct freedom to shape, modify, redefine, dismantle and rebuild without the constraints of limited budgets and resources,” said Hardy. “The canvas is limitless, a vast expanse to explore the human condition, character depth, and boundless realms, all only limited by our collective imagination. It’s an honor to have the opportunity to work alongside such industry legends as Scott, Frank, and Ryan in helping to bring the Arcbound universe to life. They have created an epic world that is as exciting to explore for those who enjoy comics as it is for those who create them.””&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Arcbound Studios will partner with a publisher to distribute the issues into stores, with details to be announced at a later date.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Arcbound_Cover_RyanOttley-copy-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s exciting to have the opportunity to collaborate with Scott, Ryan, and Tom in building this vast universe from the ground up, embedding within it an epic tale that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking,” said Tieri in a statement. “Arcbound is not only a grand space opera; we’re unfolding a narrative that challenges, questions, and introspects into the very core of our existence, compelling readers to ponder the meaning of humanity, the prices we pay as a society, and ultimately, to evaluate — is it all truly worth it?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Arcbound_Cover_ClayMaan-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The first 12 issues are described as an inaugural season for the story. Said Arcbound Studios CEO Nick Rose of effort: “The debut of Arcbound is a proud moment for us all. Bringing together this brilliant team and working alongside friends has been nothing short of transformative. Their combined creativity has given life to a story that resonates deeply, and I’m thrilled to share our collaborative magic with the world.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLW7zGafmqqUrnqivsKbpq6mlGK7psOMsqaro12YvK61wmaaqKZdZn90gZVqbGxxYGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
