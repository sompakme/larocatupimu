The actress and singer was decked out in an all-black <a href=#>Yves Saint Laurent</a> look with a pair of chic shades. Cameron even snapped an <a href=#>Instagram</a> pic with Grammy-award-winning producer Diplo to cap off the night.</p><p>Although Dove Cameron wasn’t up for any of the awards last night, she witnessed Grammy history as Beyonce became the record-holder for most Grammy wins with 88 nominations and 32 wins. There were also some great performances from <a href=#>Bad Bunny</a> and some of hip-hop’s greatest artists with a 50 Years of Hip-Hop tribute medley. In other words, it seems like it was a great ceremony to attend.</p><p>Of course, Dove Cameron has her own new music on the way, which could very well show up in the Grammy noms next year. The artist is set to release her debut studio album titled Celestial Body sometime in 2023. She had a great 2022 as well, as her song “Boyfriend” went viral on TikTok and she ended up winning Best New Artist at the American Music Awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/keegan-michael-key-dove-cameron-schmigadoon-900x562.jpg><p>As for 2023, we can also look forward to hearing Dove Cameron belt out some tunes in the second season of the Apple TV+ series Schmigadoon! Schmigadoon! is a musical comedy that follows backpacking couple Josh (<a href=#>Keegan-Michael Key</a>) and Melissa (Cecily Strong), who accidentally wander into a magical town where the townspeople sing and dance. The first season paid homage to the Golden Age of musical theater in the 1940s and 1950s.</p><p>The second season will see Josh and Melissa discovering the city of Schmicago, which will pay homage to the musicals of the ’60s and ’70s. Tituss Burgess and Patrick Page will join the cast along with returning cast members Dove Cameron, Ariana DeBose,&nbsp;Martin Short, Jaime Camil,&nbsp;Kristin Chenoweth,&nbsp;Alan Cumming,&nbsp;Ann Harada,&nbsp;Jane Krakowski, and&nbsp;Aaron Tveit. You can check out Season 2 of Shmigadoon! when it hits Apple TV+ on April 7.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll also get some forward momentum on Dove Cameron’s Powerpuff series, which is currently in development limbo. The series is a live-action remake of the popular Cartoon Network animated series <a href=#>The Powerpuff Girls</a>. Unfortunately, issues have plagued the show’s production and we have yet to hear good news about development moving forward.</p><p>The biggest blow to the Powerpuff series was when the pilot script leaked online, and essentially the entire internet hated it. The script is supposed to be undergoing major rewrites, but it lost star Chloe Bennet in the meantime. Dove Cameron is still set to play Bubbles and Yana Perrault will play Buttercup, but it appears that the series will need to find a new Blossom before they can begin filming.</p><p>There haven’t been any new developments on Powerpuff recently, but we’ll keep you updated once anything is announced. For now, we can just look forward to hearing Dove Cameron’s debut album and her appearance in Shmigadoon! later this Spring. Stay tuned for more news on her latest projects.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tnlKTDpnnCmqSeqp%2BjerSx17JkpZmTmnqjvsBnn62lnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
