If you’re looking to escape the cold and head to the beach, pool, or anywhere else you might be donning a swimsuit, dealing with your bikini line is undoubtedly on your mind. There aren’t many pleasant options for managing unwanted hair in the area — using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>waxing kit</a> can be painful and shaving can trigger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>razor bumps</a> and sensitivity. Although there are alternatives, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>laser treatments </a>or the (somewhat) less painful sugar wax, they can feel a little daunting for pain-averse people. A great alternative? At-home bikini trimmers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bikini trimmers are <strong>electric hair removal devices that cut hair without blades touching the skin</strong>, minimizing the risk of skin irritations and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ingrown hairs</a>. Because they don’t directly glide over the skin, they tend to be a “<strong>safer option for those with sensitive skin</strong>,” says NYC-based board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Marisa Garshick</a>. And best of all, it can be<strong> done in less than 10 minutes </strong>from the comfort of your own home. Bikini trimmers are also a gift from heaven for anyone with sensitive skin or is prone to ingrown hairs, as trimmers don't actually ever touch the skin; they just hover.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-bushbalm-the-francesca-body--bikini-trimmer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bushbalm The Francesca</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bush Balm The Francesca Body + Bikini Trimmer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/h0Ap9IIDGj3GCPtBprUklCr9v24=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-francesca-body---bikini-trimmer-edc9f32eba224663967da87ceb7a279b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bush Balm</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s water-resistant and rechargeable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no refill blades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bushbalm’s Body + Bikini trimmer is a triple threat — it’s waterproof, rechargeable, and boosts a whopping five-hour battery life. Equipped with a USB cord, it’s easy to charge and take on vacation in case you need to do touch-ups before hitting the beach or pool. The fact that you can hop in the shower with it and use it as part of your <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>everything showers</a> is a nice bonus. It has an adjustable guard, so you can use it for<strong> </strong>three different hair lengths, making it suitable for more than just your bikini line. Consider it your partner-in-crime for your legs and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>underarms</a>, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wet/Dry skin: </strong>Both<strong> </strong>|<strong> Attachments: </strong>Guard, travel bag, cleaning brush, lubricant<strong> </strong>|<strong> Trimming Lengths: </strong>3<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>Yes<strong>&nbsp; </strong>|<strong> Power Source: </strong>USB cord<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-veet-sensitive-precision-beauty-style-hair-removal-electric-trimmer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Veet Sensitive Precision Beauty Style Hair Removal Electric Trimmer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Veet Sensitive Precision Beauty Style Hair Removal Electric Trimmer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Cb14dJz-mLIyzVRRdKIEAbgkAJ0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Veet-Sensitive-Precision-Beauty-Style-Hair-Removal-Electric-Trimmer-3f11aad7006749788a274eedc32e2898.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a plethora of attachments for different trimming needs.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Depending on how often its used, you can zip through batteries pretty fast.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A great drugstore bikini trimmer option is this one from the trusted brand Veet.

This way, you don’t need to worry about packing the whole dock while on the go. Once fully charged, the device gives 90 minutes of continuous power, which is more than enough time even if you worked through every single hairy body part. Good to use wet and dry, the Olov Electric trimmer comes with two adjustable trimming guards, so you really can get through different areas, like underarms, with this device.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wet/Dry Skin: </strong>Both<strong> </strong>|<strong> Attachments: </strong>Nose trimmer, 2 guards |<strong> Trimming Lengths: </strong>2 |<strong>&nbsp; Waterproof: </strong>Yes |<strong> Power Source: </strong>Dock, USB cord</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-trimmer-with-guard-happy-curves-smoothie-bikini-trimmer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Trimmer with Guard</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Happy Curves Smoothie Bikini Trimmer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Happy Curves Smoothie Bikini Trimmer " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MXKJf9IhCpf4iedWtpO7y9WTVjA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/happy-curves-smoothie-bikini-trimmer-bc71de99855a462c9357931f3b5f491b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The customization capabilities are a huge plus.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>It may be difficult to reach smaller areas, like down and back there.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A trim guard attaches itself over the blades and protects the hairs from getting cut too short or too long, keeping everything an even length. It also blocks the blades from directly touching the skin and therefore is safer to use. The Happy Curves Smoothie Bikini Trimmer comes with two adjustable guards, one that provides a one to five-millimeter shave and another for a seven to 11-millimeter shave. A foil head attachment is available for a close shave if you wish for a smoother texture.

Next, you could switch this versatile little trimmer to the foil shave for a closer cut and take a quick pass across your upper lip if that's your vibe. (We love a multi-use tool. )That’s it.

This helps to prevent ingrown hairs, and you won’t feel any tugging or pricking during the trim session. With three interchangeable attachments (exfoliating brush, foil shaver, trimmer), you can really customize the experience and look to your liking.

Trusted brand Venus created an Intimate Grooming Electric Razor that can be used in and out of the shower, on wet and on dry skin. So whether you’re doing your everything-shower or needing a quick touch up, this is the tool to use. Specifically designed for thicker hair (which usually is the case for hair down there), the blade claims to be tug and pain-free. It also already comes with one AA battery included, but make sure you have a few backup ones available for when it runs out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>For Wet/Dry Skin: </strong>Both<strong> </strong>|<strong> Attachments: </strong>Trimmer head<strong> </strong>|<strong> Trimming Lengths: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Waterproof: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Power Source: </strong>AA batteries</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-women-finishing-touch-flawless-nu-razor-electric-razor></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Women</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Finishing Touch Flawless Nu Razor Electric Razor</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Finishing Touch Flawless Nu Razor " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5Y7TpWPTnQesTFUS9WcTag1cKTM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/finishing-touch-flawless-nu-razor-42c9a1ad8abf4264aa8104f57bdce05f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s small, portable, and easy to use anytime, anywhere.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The styling options and trim lengths are very limited.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Finishing Touch Flawless Nu Razor is the closest thing you’ll get to a two-in-one razor and trimmer product. The safety guard ensures your skin remains unharmed while tiny little razors snip snap the hairs right off the surface. It even comes with a safety guard for more sensitive areas (like down there), but the head is small enough to get a good precision shave if you wish to use it on your face.

In order to choose, let’s first define the differences between the two. According to Dr. Garshick, “Bikini trimmers use floating blades that help to shorten the hairs, unlike razors which shave the hairs and may pull at the skin”. Trimmers are less likely to cause ingrown hairs, she explains, so anyone prone to this skin condition may prefer a bikini trimmer. If you have an adjustable trimmer, you can choose the length of hair that the trimmer will snip.<p>As for the number of blades, board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Lauren Penzi</a> recommends “at least two for the majority of people, and three if you are prone to irritation and/or ingrown hairs.” The higher the number of blades, “the more efficient the trimming process,” she explains.&nbsp;</p></li><li><strong>Trim Lengths: </strong>If you desire more creative control over how short you want the hair to be cut, then we recommend opting for a trimmer with multiple trim lengths. These options come with guards that can be adjusted and block the space between the skin and the blade at your desired length. This way, you can change the look of your underarm hair versus your bikini line and get more usage out of your bikini trimmer.</li><li><strong>Features: </strong>Many of today’s top bikini trimmers offer a range of helpful features. Some, but not all, are waterproof, allowing you to trim while in the shower. It’s important to pay attention to this distinction before you make a purchase as you don’t want to accidentally carry a non-waterproof electric device into the water stream. Some models also come with safety attachments, various comb heads for different trimming results, and LED lights for improved visibility.</li><li><strong>Water Resistance: </strong>The nice difference between a razor and a trimmer is that you can go water-free with a trimmer. That being said, if you prefer to accomplish everything in one go under the shower, there are plenty of water-resistant options on this list that allow you to take your trimmer into the shower. Do not accidentally take your non-water-resistant trimmer into the shower as it can be a hazard.</li><li><strong>Skin Type: </strong>According to both Dr. Penzi and board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Divya Shokeen</a>, bikini trimmers are safe for all skin types, including sensitive skin, eczema, and keratosis pilaris. “Trimmers cut the hair straight across, unlike shaving, and usually have built-in safety features like rounded blades or guards to prevent nicks and irritation,” says Dr. Penzi. To boot, Dr. Shokeen adds that “they are easier on those with sensitive skin because no products or irritants are necessarily applied in order to use a trimmer.”<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are bikini trimmers safe to use?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, bikini trimmers are safe to use, but according to Dr. Garshick, if they’re not used correctly, they can contribute to cuts, ingrown hairs, scarring, and skin irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Trimmers are less likely to cause ingrown hairs compared to using razors and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>shaving cream</a>, but it’s still a possibility. “Given the skin in the groin area is particularly delicate and sensitive, any injury to the hair can lead to potential hyperpigmentation or scarring,” says Dr. Garshick. “That said, trimmers are considered a good option for those with sensitive skin.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you use a bikini trimmer?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Before you get started, check whether the trimmer is water-resistant to determine whether it can be used in the shower or not.

If you’re prone to ingrown hairs, swap your cleanser for a salicylic- or glycolic acid-based <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>exfoliant</a> to remove any dead skin cells and gunk from the area.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If it is waterproof, you’re free to use it in the shower, although you should still follow the same cleansing steps outlined above before trimming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best way to use a bikini trimmer, according to Dr. Garshick, is to hold the skin taut with one hand while trimming with the other to allow for a more consistent and comfortable shave. Also, make sure you shave in the direction of the hair to prevent razor burn or ingrown hairs. Lastly, make sure to change the razor every two to three weeks.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How should you treat your skin after using a bikini trimmer?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“It's important to moisturize your skin immediately after using a bikini trimmer,” says board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Dr. Lindsey Zubritsky</a>. “This helps to protect the skin barrier, reduce the risk of razor burn, and decrease the risk of irritation.” She recommends using a fragrance-free <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>lotion</a> or cream that is labeled as non-comedogenic, which will moisturize skin without clogging pores.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Does trimming pubic hair make it prickly?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bikini trimmers typically do leave some stubble since they do not shave as close to the skin as traditional razors do, says Dr. Zubritsky.
