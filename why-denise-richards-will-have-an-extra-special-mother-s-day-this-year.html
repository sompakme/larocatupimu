Speaking of their fallout in February 2022, <a class=hm-link href=#>Denise said</a> on Sirius XM's Jeff Lewis Live: "It's very difficult. I know we'll get back to where we were eventually, but right now, it is strained."</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Denise Richards looks "so pretty" in this Instagram video</figure><p id=eBdNtPBGH0 data-wc=30>The 52-year-old added: "She lived with me all these years. There are certain rules and I enforce them. And [at Charlie's], there's different rules at that house and that's OK."</p><p id=eugVqoisL8 data-wc=36>However, the pair have since reconciled with one another, with <a class=hm-link href=#>Sami spending Thanksgiving</a> with her mom. The pair's reconciliation happened last year around Mother's Day, with Sami sharing a tribute to the mom-of-three at the time.</p><p id=eixJrbLrMiC data-wc=12><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Denise Richards wows in figure-hugging blue swimsuit in latest poolside photo</a></p><p id=eqh3hMZa0K data-wc=60>Alongside a series of snaps of the pair together, Sami shared: "Happy mother's day!! I love u so much mom. u have no idea how grateful i am to have u in my life." Denise shared a heartfelt response to the post, and revealed that she and Sami had even gone out for a meal together for the special day.</p><p id=eUW26bMRCx data-wc=41>"Thank you Sami for an amazing Mother's Day. It means a lot to me. I know nana was at dinner with us she would never miss one of her favorite restaurants. Thank you & I love you so much," she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14496b6bbef0-denise-richards-sami-black-and-white.jpg><p id=eAehfjmBMo data-wc=54>Back in March, the star took to Instagram to share a <a class=hm-link href=#>stunning photo of her eldest child</a> in honor of her 19th birthday alongside an emotional message. In the image, Sami is gazing into the distance with her long blonde hair falling over her shoulder and the sun beaming against her skin.</p><p id=eGcaBMVuRi data-wc=44>Paying tribute to Sami, Denise lovingly wrote: "Happy Birthday my beautiful Sami girl! I love you so much & I am so proud of you and your heart is even more gorgeous. I love you so much. Happy 19th Birthday!!!! I love you @samisheen."</p><p id=eYMzkbASCY data-wc=51>Sami takes after her mom in many ways, and the teenager often wows <a class=hm-link href=#>with beautiful photos</a> that she shares on her social media feeds. Earlier this year she <a class=hm-link href=#>emphasized her impressive toned abs</a>, which are as it turns out very similar to those her mother showed off during her younger days.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6216e33e9336-denise-richards-family-meal.jpg><p id=eOucTiy5t- data-wc=58>While attending Vanity Fair's post-Oscars party back in March 2000, the then 29-year-old gave fans a glimpse of her similarly toned midriff when she wore a striped and sparkly silver glitter crop top and pants combo. And while that photo was taken over 20 years ago, Denise's recent Instagram pics suggest she's still keeping impressively in shape today.</p><p id=eK6g09nlVL data-wc=10><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Denise Richards, 52, looks phenomenal in see-through white corset</a></p><p id=eXYjNEbTo3 data-wc=18><strong>MORE: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Denise Richards looks sensational in a cut-out black dress for celebratory night out with husband Aaron Cameron</a></p><p id=e9gdYn_cYf data-wc=29>During a <a class=hm-link href=#>previous holiday</a>, Sami looked like her famous mom and fans commented on her appearance and her tropical surroundings as they added on-fire emojis and wrote: "Absolutely beautiful."</p><p id=eaqOxMCaw6 data-wc=8>See some of Denise's sweetest family moments below...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/152fe381d543-denise-richards-lola-zipline.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0460cb1965a1-denise-richards-eloise-plane.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6b429db3e060-denise-richards-daughters.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/75a9feaf418f-denise-richards-lola-disney.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d93ea491a47-denise-richards-eloise-smile.jpg><p id=enlxbpqH7s data-wc=6><strong>Read more <a class=hm-link href=#>HELLO!
