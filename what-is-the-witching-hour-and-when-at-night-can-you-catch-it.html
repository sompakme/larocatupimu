However, some people are convinced that the reason why nothing good ever happens at 3 a.m. is because of this mysterious theory.</p><p class=align-left>Stories about the witching hours surround our culture these days, with lots of cautionary tales being told to kids about that dreadful time of night.</p><p class=align-left>Your brother or sister may have once terrified you with a story of the invisible ‘friends’ who can mimic your voice and even appearance, creeping in your closet late at night.

The thin veil allows evil beings such as demons to cross over into our world. It is said that this is the time when ghosts, witches, and demons are at their most powerful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7d99791d8d8c7e5c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>33-year-old mum suffering from spinal tuberculosis finally walks after samaritans donated N6.6m for surgery</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Puppies are also said to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">have a witching hour</a>. Most puppies tend to engage in rowdy behaviour at this time, some tearing things present in their surroundings and others engaging in increased levels of mouthing behaviour. The time may vary for all puppies, but it is common in the early mornings or late evenings.</p><p class=align-left>We also have the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">witching hour for babies</a>. It is believed to occur when young babies, about 2-3 weeks old, cry for a long period, turning themselves into fussy and inconsolable children. The crying peaks at around week 6 and eventually comes to an end when the baby is three months old. The witching hour period for babies takes place anywhere from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m.</p><p class=align-left>However, as much fun as it is to talk about puppies and adorable but fussy babies, we are going to focus our attention on the king of all witching hours, the supernatural witching hour that keeps some of you awake at night. So, what time is witching hour?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4bf248407a07e763.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lady organises class for Nigerian men, teaches them how to bathe babies, change diapers, video goes viral</span></p></a><h2>When is the witching hour?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a874d0a797aa2bf5.jpg><p class=align-left>There is a great debate on what time is the witching hour. This is mainly because people living in different parts of the world with different time zones cannot have it at the same time.</p><p class=align-left>The time zone debate is based on the premise that there can only be one worldwide time for the devil to do his work. Another argument surrounding this phenomenon has to do with the start of the day. Some consider midnight to be the real witching hour.</p><p class=align-left>Regardless of these debates, 3 a.m. is commonly the most accepted time that this phenomenon is believed to occur.</p><h2>What is the history of the witching hour?</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The witching hour</a> is considered significant as it is the opposite hour to the one in which Jesus Christ died on the cross. The correlation between these two events seem to make sense when you consider the fact that Jesus died for the sins of humanity to save us from evil, whilst the Devil and his demons are said to be working day and night to do the exact opposite.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6a3d23679bcf8c63.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ wonderful new day quotes to motivate you to do great things</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Moreover, the number 3 is used to describe the Holy Trinity; God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit. From a Biblical perspective, the number 3 holds a huge and very recognizable significance, hence, the association with the Devil too, as a mockery of the Holy One.</p><p class=align-left>The term itself is believed to have been coined by Pope Pius IV in 1560. In the years between the 16th and 18th century, there rose a trend of witch-hunting. This led to the execution of more than an estimated number of 60,000 people during witch trials.</p><p class=align-left>These witch trials, as they were called, came about due to the several misfortunes that had befallen the people living in Europe at the time. A lot of citizens blamed it on witchcraft which prompted widespread panic and suspicion. People ended up turning on those they assumed were practicing witchcraft.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7d99791d8d8c7e5c.jpg><p class=align-left>Rumours started spreading that the dark art activities were being performed in the early mornings. Henceforth, an agreement was eventually made stating that this phenomenon occurred from between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m, hence the witching hours.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/99c85b7cb88bbac6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Beautiful healing quotes to help you get through the tough times</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Catholic Church, under Pope John Paul II, took this matter seriously that they wrote down rules prohibiting activities during this time. Anybody who was found moving up and down at this time was labelled unholy and eventually punished.</p><p class=align-left>The witching hour did not start with the witch trials alone. Many cultures around the world have a history of witchcraft. Witches and wizards have always been associated with the dark hours of the night regardless of which culture they were found in.</p><p class=align-left>As much as we have come to believe in the possibility of the supernatural, science and technology has always found a way to showcase the myths behind these beliefs.</p><h2>The science behind the witching hour</h2><p class=align-left>Scientists and doctors have come to understand that this phenomenon has less to do with the supernatural and more to do with biology. For most of us, 3 a.m. is when our bodies reach <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">REM sleep</a> (Rapid Eye Movement sleep).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is enmeshment in a relationship and how does one deal with it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>REM sleep occurs within the first 90 minutes of falling asleep.
