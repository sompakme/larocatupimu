Even dating back to the 1800s, however, these kites were impressive â€“ - some were reportedly 20 feet long.&nbsp;However, these days, most people buy their kites, or make their own at home with more modern materials. Some locals have said that it is almost taboo to not know how to fashion a kite, because the hobby has been ingrained in the culture for such a long time. One more recent trend is "hummer" kites, also known as buzzards or Somerset kites, which emit musical notes as they float through the breeze. They are known to sound similar to a clarinet, bringing naturally-made music to the festival.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>So back to the reason for these kites: <a href=#>Britannica</a> reports that in the Christian faith, it is believed that Jesus rose to heaven 40 days after his Easter resurrection. The event is marked on the Christian calendar as the Feast of the Ascension.
