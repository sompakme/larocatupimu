And in a post-ceremony backstage interview, the 2024 <a href=# id=auto-tag_oscars_1 data-tag=oscars>Oscars</a> host shed light on the moment being quickly incorporated into the broadcast.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Toward the end of the 2024 telecast, four-time Oscars host <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/jimmy-kimmel-calls-out-donald-trump-2024-oscars-1235847254/>Kimmel had responded to a critical social media post</a> from the former president after he was told that he has a bit of extra time before the night’s top <a href=# id=auto-tag_awards_1 data-tag=awards>awards</a> were handed out, telling the audience, “I’m really proud of something and I was wondering if I could share it with you. I just got a review.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The late night host then proceeded to read a post that Trump shared on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars,” the former president pondered. “His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not, and never can be. Get rid of Kimmel and perhaps replace him with another washed up, but cheap, ABC ‘talent,’ George Slopanopoulos. He would make everybody on stage look bigger, stronger, and more glamorous.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Trump then moved on from his take on Kimmel’s hosting work and into his overall critique of the broadcast. “Also a really bad politically correct show tonight, and for years – Disjointed, boring, and very unfair. Why don’t they just give the Oscars to those that deserve them,” the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination <a rel=nofollow href=#>wrote on Truth Social.</a> “Maybe that way their audience and TV ratings will come back from the depths. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the Oscars, the audience erupted into laughter as the post was read to them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“See if you can guess which former president just posted that?” the host asked. “Anyone? No? Well, thank you, President Trump. Thank you for watching, I’m&nbsp;surprised you’re still — isn’t&nbsp;it past your jail time?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">After the show, Kimmel spoke with his fellow ABC talk show hosts <a href=# id=auto-tag_kelly-ripa_1 data-tag=kelly-ripa>Kelly Ripa</a> and Mark Consuelos during their post-show Live special. He told the duo that he was went against advice from some he spoke with backstage, who advised him against reading Trump’s rant aloud during the ceremony.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They’re like, ‘You’ve got a little bit of time’ and I was like, ‘I’m reading the Trump tweet,’ and they’re like, ‘No, no, don’t read that,’” Kimmel revealed. “[I was like] ‘Yes I am.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Sunday marked the TV personality’s fourth time hosting the Academy Awards. He told Ripa and Consuelos that he was feeling “pretty good” about how it went at the Dolby Theatre on Sunday; critics seem to agree that he was pretty good as host this time, with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/2024-oscars-review-jimmy-kimmel-ryan-gosling-emma-stone-1235848832/>The Hollywood Reporter‘s chief TV critic Daniel Fienberg noting</a> in his review that Kimmel is “a guy you can trust to do a monologue and then he’ll hold together the disparate components and fill dead air and generally keep the mood light. He’s a juggler, and no matter what Razzie winner Trump might say, a good awards show host.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kimmel and Trump have a history of needling one another. (For Kimmel’s second Oscars hosting outing in 2018, the pair went back and forth<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-slams-donald-trump-again-oscars-ratings-tweet-1092615/> over who was “lowest rated.”) </a>The Jimmy Kimmel Live! host has made Trump a common target of his monologues, and the former president, known for live-tweeting about some of Hollywood’s biggest events, has made the Academy Awards the target of some of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/narcissism-expert-analyzes-trumps-tweets-oscars-he-wants-be-respected-by-hollywood-guest-column-977568/>his most withering tweets, dating back to 2014</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/jimmy-kimmel-interview-oscars-plans-barbie-trump-oppenheimer-1235840212/>talking to THR ahead of the Oscars</a> about heading into another election year focused on Trump, the late night host said he enjoys getting a rise out of the former POTUS.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I kind of love it, because I know it bothers him and that really tickles me. And then occasionally, we get confirmation of that and it inspires me. He is my muse,” said Kimmel of talking about him on-air.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As of Monday morning, no follow-up comment has appeared on Trump’s Truth Social page. Same for Kimmel on X, though the host returns to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday night with new material.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOo6CmpaliuKq5zJ6jZpyfo66tsIytqa6loGJ%2FcX6TZqasm5GnwG65xJqlZqynmrK1eZBram5wZG6Bc3yO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
