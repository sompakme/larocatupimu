Fox said Magic probably knew it wasn't working anymore and felt like he had to make the change.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I think ya gotta be true to the core of what makes you who you are," Fox said. "If he was losing that fire and losing some of that fuel that makes him go and to be who he is then its a disservice to the Lakers for him to stay there and be in that space."</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
