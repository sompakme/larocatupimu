He enjoyed telling stories even from an early age, and would even bug his elementary school teacher to let him give presentations to the class on unexplained phenomena like the Mothman or the Jersey Devil. He discovered his love of writing while working on the University of Central Florida's late-night comedy show "ToKnight's the Night," where he wrote comedy sketches and monologue jokes. After graduation, he returned to his hometown in Central Pennsylvania and worked for a local news website before writing sports and pop culture articles for the men's website BroBible. In his free time, Matt is a huge fan of the Philadelphia Flyers, enjoys watching any form of auto racing, and playing guitar.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>Matt graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2018 where he studied both Radio-Television and Creative Writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCt1K2fqKpfoq61wNGeoKCklWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
