It was&nbsp;Dídi, a coming-of-age film about a 13-year-old in the Bay Area from a first-time feature director with no notable U.S. stars. It quickly landed a deal with Focus Features, while films with shinier stars and higher concepts are still in negotiations for deals.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The U.S. has long been known as the great arbiter of “bigger is better.” But being risk-averse, given current economic conditions and industry trends back home (Disney, Paramount Global, Amazon MGM, and others are currently undergoing layoffs), may, says one U.S. buyer,&nbsp;“no longer mean getting a massive star or big director — it means costing less.” Yet, internationally, the mandate seems to be business as usual, at least where theatrical is concerned.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 2023 work stoppages have created massive holes in Hollywood studios’ 2024 release calendars. One top U.S. sales agent notes the studios’ need for “shoulder programming” out of festivals: films that can easily slot into the liminal spaces between tentpoles, many of which are rushing to finish production after the strike work stoppages and are prone to move.&nbsp;Dídi&nbsp;was dated this week for a mid-summer release, falling in between parent company Universal’s remake of&nbsp;Twister&nbsp;and a Blumhouse horror movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Out of Sundance, other smaller films like&nbsp;Kneecap&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ghostlight&nbsp;quickly and easily found homes. Gone may be the days of the $25 million sales (the closest at Sundance this year was a $17 million price tag for worldwide rights to the thriller&nbsp;It’s What’s Inside,&nbsp;which went to Netflix), as the U.S. industry is placing a premium on agile productions that won’t require a massive P&A spend or even the widest releases to re-coup investment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On the <a href=# id=auto-tag_international_1 data-tag=international>international</a> market, particularly Europe, where P&A costs are lower and there is a stronger mix of mid-to-large independent players (StudioCanal, Leonine, Gaumont, Eagle Pictures), buyers remain hungry for bigger, star-driven productions, films they can release wide and go up against studio films in their respective territories.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“On the international market I feel a real desire for theatrical movies, for bigger films,” says&nbsp;Tamara Birkemoe&nbsp;of Palisades Park Pictures, who flew in British director&nbsp;Ben Gregor&nbsp;to pitch Berlin buyers on his upcoming adaptation of&nbsp;Enid Blyton’s&nbsp;The Magic Faraway Tree, a four-quadrant family film with an adapted screenplay by&nbsp;Wonka&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paddington 2&nbsp;writer&nbsp;Simon Farnaby.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The bulk of the bigger pre-sales titles in Berlin — CAA and FilmNation’s&nbsp;Roofman&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Channing Tatum;&nbsp;David Mackenzie’s thriller&nbsp;Fuze&nbsp;with&nbsp;Aaron Taylor-Johnson&nbsp;from Anton, UTA and WME Independent; or the&nbsp;Dave Bautista and Samuel L. Jackson&nbsp;actioner&nbsp;Afterburn&nbsp;from Black Bear and CAA — are looking to those global buyers to pony up the financing to get these movies made.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">30West and CAA Media Finance did just that late Saturday, inking a deal, reportedly for around $50 million with&nbsp;Sony&nbsp;Pictures to package&nbsp;A Big Bold Beautiful Journey, a romantic fantasy from After Yang director Kogonada to star Margot Robbie and&nbsp;Colin Farrell. Much of the appeal of such a star-driven, big-budget project will be international, explaining Sony’s decision to take global rights.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For smaller movies, instead of first selling internationally, a U.S. presale often proceeds global deals.&nbsp;Julia von Heinz’s intimate Holocaust-themed drama&nbsp;Treasure,&nbsp;starring&nbsp;Lena Dunham&nbsp;and&nbsp;Stephen Fry, presold to FilmNation and Bleecker Street, which will release the film in the U.S. on June 14, with FilmNation using Berlin to complete global sales. Bleecker Street also pre-bought domestic on&nbsp;Mike Leigh’s new film&nbsp;Hard Truths&nbsp;featuring his&nbsp;Secrets & Lies&nbsp;star&nbsp;Marianne Jean-Baptiste, a film Cornerstone is presenting to international buyers in Berlin.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Looking to past markets like Cannes, some of the biggest packages didn’t announce any U.S. pre-buys (cases in point:&nbsp;Daisy Ridley&nbsp;hanging off the side of London’s Shard for&nbsp;Casino Royale&nbsp;director&nbsp;Martin Campbell&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone&nbsp;hanging off the side of a cliff in the&nbsp;Cliffhanger&nbsp;sequel). Then again, Cannes was happening just as the U.S. writers had announced their work stoppage and the actors’ strike was looking more likely with every passing day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But “small” films, even those with top pedigree behind them, aren’t a sure bet for the U.S. studios until they can be proven quantities. Berlin opener&nbsp;Small Things Like These, the quiet Cillian Murphy-led drama, sources note, was shopped to several stateside studios as a package by producers, including Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s Artists Equity, before heading to the fest with FilmNation. Now, with overwhelmingly positive reviews,&nbsp;Small Things&nbsp;could be poised to split the difference between domestic needs for small-scale content and the international desire for star power (such as the recently Oscar-nominated Murphy) and garner a big deal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Says one agency packager: “We will sell these big movies to the international buyers first and hold back domestic for a possible studio or streamer deal.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKOx0aWgp2WWnrmuecOemKWlkaC2r7OMoaalpKmsvLCwjKKlrZ2io661tc6nmKVlYWeAdoSRcW5vbF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
