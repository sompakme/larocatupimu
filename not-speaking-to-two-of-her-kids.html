I'm going to let you in on a little secret: I'm currently not speaking to two of my three kids right now,” Ripa explained, referencing her children with husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mark Consuelos</a>: Michael, 22, Lola, 18, and Joaquin, 17. “I'm not talking to two of them because … just because, we're all in the same boat together, right? Like, I haven't gotten to hug my parents … I want to hug my parents. I miss hugging my parents," she continued, reportedly on the verge of tears. "And my kids, like, won't hug me. And I'm like, 'Guys we've all been in lockdown together. We're fine. You can give me a hug. It's fine.’"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Anyway, I'm sorry,” Ripa told Seacrest. “I don't know why I'm crying. Maybe I'm just going to get my period, who knows? Sorry … Sorry, did I shout that? Did my inner monologue come out? Sorry, I didn't mean to do that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ripa also shared her sympathy with her eldest, whose graduation from NYU in May has been postponed. "I feel so bad for my son Michael, who was supposed to graduate in a couple of weeks,” she said. "And I really feel bad for my dad who delayed having knee surgery that he can't obviously have now for so many myriad reasons. He was so looking forward to, you know, watching his grandson graduate from college.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Checking her privilege, Ripa added, “And again, these are small problems considering that so many people are losing their loved ones and [are] very, very sick. But it just, it is what it is. Michael, by the way, is not bothered at all."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of her children who is “bothered” by the pandemic’s effect on his education is Joaquin, who was “not relieved” by the New York State Education Department’s cancelation of the Regents Exams in June. "It's so funny because my youngest, Joaquin, he’s so different than my other two kids, who would have been dancing, just dancing around the house,” Ripa explained. “They would have been so excited. But he has this level of anxiety from it. He felt so prepared for his exams.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Word to the Consuelos bunch: Give your mom a hug!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGebmrmtxYyroKmZXaC2pb%2BMp6atZaOlsqK3yKeeZqyfYrWmvg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
