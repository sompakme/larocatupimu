But be forewarned, they range from impressively crafty to just plain dangerous.</p><p>Ladies, if you've ever caught your man reaching for a mascara wand—fear not. In Ancient Egypt, men used to style their lashes just as often as women. They used kohl and ointments to darken the lashes, which also served as protection for their eyes from the sun's harmful rays. Not to be outdone, women also used malachite on their lashes&nbsp;as they believed it worked as an aphrodisiac. We'll stick to oysters, thank you.</p><p>In Rome, eyelashes that were long, thick, and curled were a sought-after beauty trait. Women&nbsp;used kohl and burnt cork to darken their eyelashes. Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder wrote that lashes fell out from excessive sex—yes,&nbsp;seriously—so women would also look after them to prove their chastity.</p><p>During Medieval Times, the forehead was considered to be the most beautiful and erotic feature of a woman's face. To further emphasize them, women often&nbsp;removed either most or all of their eyelashes and eyebrows. That's certainly a&nbsp;look.</p><p>When Queen Elizabeth took the throne, her reddish-golden hair was instantly en vogue and women dyed their eyelashes to match. However, this proved very dangerous,&nbsp;as certain toxic substances used resulted in hair loss. (Um, cute?)&nbsp;Since dyeing lashes wasn't&nbsp;a fully accepted custom in&nbsp;society, women would frequently do it in private,&nbsp;secretly using crushed berries and soot from fireplaces.</p><p>[image id='6fff673c-c216-47ac-b882-57f6e0f83d5f' mediaId='5d2ce142-5581-42a7-bf0a-2d9b7e971108' share='true' expand='true' loc='C'][/image]</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

The first mascara was developed by Eugène Rimmel (yes,&nbsp;that&nbsp;Rimmel), a perfumer to Queen Victoria, and was primarily comprised of coal dust and Vaseline jelly. His invention caused quite&nbsp;a sensation.</p><p>Although alternatives were available, many women were still looking to household products to make their own formulas. It's said that in 1916, fake eyelashes were invented by American film director David W. Griffith to create a&nbsp;fluttering lash&nbsp;effect for silent film actresses. Even so, they didn't become popular until the '30s.</p><p>In 1917, a woman named Mabel Williams worked with a drug manufacturer to come up with "Lash-Brow-Ine," a formula made of petroleum jelly and oils to provide sheen. Eventually, their trademark became Maybelline and over the next decade, they became a household name.</p><p>While there's discrepancy over who exactly invented the eyelash curler, a 1931 patent claims it was William McDonell who called it the Kurlash. It wasn't too different from the curling wonders&nbsp;of today—made of stainless steel and modeled after scissors. They become very popular as they curled the lashes within seconds&nbsp;and&nbsp;were relatively inexpensive. In 1933, the term mascara came into play and Maybelline designed a 10-cent package sold in drugstores.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zuTjHmrJSKXkkgGJm9GssM-1920-80.jpg><p><br>Actress Gabrielle Ray, late 1800s; Gloria Swanson, 1923; Geraldine Brooks, 1940</p><p>At the time, makeup was all about emphasizing the peepers—and painting cat eyes&nbsp;on the upper lashline, with fanned-out lashes to match, was a trend. In the early '40s, waterproof mascara formulas were introduced and became very popular. In 1958, Revlon introduced the first mascara package in a tube with a spiral-tip wand.</p><p>In 1960, Revlon invented the first colored formula with its "Brush on Mascara," which came in hues like mauve and dark green. At the time, full, dramatic, and slightly-spidery lashes were in and&nbsp;more attention was&nbsp;given&nbsp;to the lower lashes than ever. Women also opted for painted, brush-stroke lashes à la Twiggy. It was in 1971 that cult-favorite Maybelline Great Lash, a water-based mascara, hit the market. It's one of our favorites to&nbsp;this day.</p><p>In 1988, Max Factor created No Color Mascara, a clear formula that boasted a smudge-proof finish. Madonna was also at the height of popularity, making full, fan-like eyelashes all the more coveted. In the more-is-more late '80s and early '90s, colored mascara also experienced a revival in Rainbow Brite hues. In fact, women used "hair mascara" to paint rainbow streaks in their hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kjWTh8N2HTtvA6Jv4uQ99g-1920-80.jpg><p><br>Elizabeth Taylor, 1950; Twiggy, 1967; Madonna, 1986</p><p>Yes, the bigger, the better—but still, the beauty of lashes today is that they can be whatever kind you want them to be.
