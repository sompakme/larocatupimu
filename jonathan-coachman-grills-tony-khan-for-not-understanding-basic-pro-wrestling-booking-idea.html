This was all stemmed from <a href=#>a troll tweet from The USA Network account,</a> and it snowballed into a lot more.</p><p>AEW has a lot of defenders, and <a href=#>Tony Khan is right up there with the most vocal</a>. TK was at it again today, as the USA Network’s tweet about Cagematch’s ratings triggered Khan.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, Tony Khan posted on Twitter to defend his booking, and his company, while throwing some shade at Jinder Maha. For the record, Jinder Mahal already replied, <a href=#>which broke near two-year silent streak on Twitter in the process</a>.</p><p>Jonathan Coachman saw that tweet from Tony Khan, and he couldn’t help but reply. He made a point that pro wrestling is about stories, and not win/loss records. That being said, if it makes sense for a story, then it should work.</p><p>We also used to get amused at fans who counted wins like wrestlers “earned” them. Hell if Vince wanted I could have been world champion. But the storyline didn’t support it. It’s about the story clearly not wins in a predetermined space. Thought a boss would understand that.</p><p>It seems that fans from all over will keep replying to Tony Khan, and a few of them just might catch his attention. If anything, this certainly shows that Tony Khan is very confident about AEW’s stance in the pro wrestling world, especially when it comes to their booking.</p><p>We will have to see what is next in the pro wrestling world. You never know what Tony Khan will tweet out next, and who will respond to him, either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on this situation with Tony Khan?
