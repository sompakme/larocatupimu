Host Henry Louis Gates Jr. “And his name is Kevin Bacon,” he added, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to The Independent</a>. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ashlyn-harris-sophia-bush.png alt="Ashlyn Harris & Sophia Bush" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Sophia Bush Gushes Over Being Set 'Free' by Ashlyn Harris in a Sweet Instagram Comment</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“See. I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!” Sedgwick responded after airing her fears that she would unearth a biological connection to the father of her two children earlier on in the show.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 2017, Sedgwick joked about the revelation at Television Critics Association’s summer press tour, while promoting her&nbsp;ABC&nbsp;Drama&nbsp;Ten Days in the Valley. “I figured I was going to be related to Kevin Bacon — I mean, most white people are related, ultimately,” Sedgwick said, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>per Observer</a>. “I wasn’t surprised, honestly. Frankly, I figured that was part the reason that they wanted to do both of us. I had to act surprised.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>From cousins to political ties and even British royalty, find out which A-listers are related to each other! <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/oeti1JP3UE</a></p><p>— SheKnows (@SheKnows) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 2, 2024</a></p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ashlyn-harris-sophia-bush.png alt="Ashlyn Harris & Sophia Bush" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">Sophia Bush Gushes Over Being Set 'Free' by Ashlyn Harris in a Sweet Instagram Comment</span></a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The discovery was very fitting given the popular trivia game&nbsp;Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon, a game that claims that anyone on earth is just six connections away from the Hollywood star. The game is based on the idea that Bacon’s extensive film career means he is connected to just about any star and, therefore, could be linked indirectly to most people in the world!</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bacon, 65, also stars in the episode and has his own reaction to the discover, and to the trivia game! “As long as we’re not first cousins, it’s fine,” he told Gates Jr.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I wasn’t in the headspace to take it as flattery,” he said of the “six degrees” trend. “I kind of felt like it was a joke at my expense, you know.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Can you believe that this loser can be connected to one of the great actors in history, you know, like Olivier or something like that in 6 Degrees? So, I didn’t look at it as a badge of honor,” Bacon explained, adding that he eventually grew to appreciate the idea of connectedness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“It’s a beautiful concept that we are connected,” he said. “That we all, essentially, kind of climbed out of the same swamp. It’s fun to be at the forefront of that idea.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Elsewhere in the episode, Gates Jr. also told Bacon about his connection to some other stars, aside from his wife. “You and Brad Pitt are 13th cousins twice removed,” he tells the Footloose star. “You and President Obama share a common ancestor named Anthony Woolhouse. You are 12th cousins, three times removed.” Bacon replies: “No kidding. I knew I wasn’t getting enough respect.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sedgwick and Bacon have been married since 1988.
