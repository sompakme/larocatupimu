The former Goldust said that’s all he wanted to do since the first time he worked security at an event.</p><p>Dusty Rhodes gave his son a fast crash course revealing the secrets of pro wrestling and then booked Dustin on a show the next day as a referee.</p><p>As Dustin Rhodes told <a href=#>Bleacher Report</a>, that first show was very memorable. Dustin Rhodes worked two matches on that card, but it was his match with the Rock n Roll Express that really stands out in his mind, especially the finish.</p><p>“Tommy Young, the lead official, is sitting on the front row, and we’ve got a curtain sellout in the back and everyone is out there watching. Ricky (Morton) and Robert (Gibson) are in there laughing with me and telling jokes. Giving me hell. But I do the match and do everything I’m supposed to. I go down for the one, two, three and I stand up and I’m raising Ricky and Robert’s hand.”</p><p>“At first the whole building is cheering, but then they start laughing. I’m worrying that I’ve screwed something up, so I look down at Tommy Young and he’s laughing his ass off too. He’s pointing at my crotch. So, I look down, and from the top of the pants down, everything is split. From the top down, basically the waistband is the only thing that didn’t tear. And I had nothing on underneath. My junk was hanging out there for the world to see. I look back at the curtain and they are all on the ground laughing.”</p><p>“It was the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to me. I ran to the back. But nobody told me not to buy cotton pants. I needed some stretchable pants. So, that was me breaking into the industry.”</p><p>Perhaps this story would have been a lot less embarrassing if Dustin Rhodes would have remembered to wear underwear in all the excitement of preparing for his first pro wrestling match.</p><p>Dustin Rhodes did a lot of bizarre things as Goldust, but at least he never went as far as he did during his first experience inside the squared circle.</p><p>September 20, 2019 10:35 am</p><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
