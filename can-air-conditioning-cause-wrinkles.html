So I appreciate it when I can find a hack that can contribute to my glow-up — and not take too much away from my bank account. Luckily, Naomi Campbell is here to help us do both!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Campbell is well-known for her beautiful, ageless skin, and she recently revealed one of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>beauty secrets</a> to Architectural Digest, which she believes has kept her skin looking timeless over the years.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While showing off her home in Kenya, the legendary supermodel explained, "I love this room; it's just chilled. We have air conditioning. I personally don't sleep in air conditioning. I don't like it; it gives wrinkles, I believe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since discovering Campbell's beauty secret, I wanted to learn more, because let's be honest, there are tons of beauty hacks out there. But the real question is, which ones actually work? Is it possible to save a coin on product while preventing your skin from aging?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I figured it was best to go right to the source by talking to skincare experts <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Adeline Kikam</a> as well as skin specialist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Skinergy Beauty</a> founder Priscilla Jiminian.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Kikam, a certified dermatologist in McAllen, Texas, "Air conditioners can reduce room air humidity, leading to a more dryer room climate. Long-term exposure in AC-controlled environments causes loss of moisture in the skin to the dry room air. This can lead to dehydrated skin, characterized by dullness, loss of plumpness, bounce, and elasticity, thus exaggerating fine lines and wrinkles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Kikam has also looked into Japanese research based on low and high humidity environments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Naomi Campbell Welcomed Her First Child</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Japanese <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>skincare study</a> published in 2007 discovered that participants had "decreases in skin conductance and elasticity and significant increases in fine wrinkles after acclimation to low humidity compared with high humidity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"By using teaching technology; they observed that skin was stiffer and folds more pronounced in low humidity," the dermatologist explains. "Although the skin was stiffer, the study participants were able to smile in low humidity vs. high humidity showing a possible connection between dry weather environments and wrinkles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So, I guess Campbell was on to something. However, the reality is, remaining in constant humidity can be uncomfortable. Digging further, I wanted to see if there is an ideal temperature. Can we have it all? Can we have perfect ageless skin and not sacrifice the temperature in our homes?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Jiminian, it's possible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ideally, keeping humidity levels at an ideal range of 30% to 50% is key," she says. "Seventy-two to 75 degrees Fahrenheit is what's recommended for comfort, saving energy, and skin. If possible, leave a slightly opened window for proper airflow. Use the energy savings mode on your air conditioner; this way, it isn't on full blast for seven to eight hours straight."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Dr. Kikam and Jiminian also had insight into unique ways to keep your skin hydrated, ageless, and flawless in your home — whether or not you want to turn on the AC.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Dr. Kikam, it's all about wearing sunscreen anytime, anywhere. "Definitely use sunscreen inside when still exposed to UVR especially UVA rays, which can penetrate even glass and are most responsible for collagen break down in skin resulting in wrinkles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And according to Jiminian, it's all about being proactive while we sleep, "Our bodies lose fluids and electrolytes while we sleep, keeping a humidifier [on] can prevent dryness and dehydration," she says. "For extra dry skin types, night creams, serums, and humectant facial mists can provide additional moisture to the skin throughout the day and while catching some Zzz's."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Skinergy Beauty's Come Correct Serum</a> for anti-aging prevention should do the trick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK6qvoycpqecmam2sLrIp55mm5GqwKq6xmauq6GeoLmmvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
