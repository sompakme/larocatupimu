She layered the outerwear over a white knit sweater and a pair of slouchy black suede boots. For accessories, the princess matched her mini handbag to her coat, toting a mossy green purse, and opted for chunky gold hoop earrings.</p><img alt="leeds, england january 31 catherine, princess of wales during a visit to kirkgate market on january 31, 2023 in leeds, england the princess of wales is undertaking engagements in london and leeds this week as part of the launch of a campaign to raise awareness of the unique importance of early childhood photo by karwai tangwireimage" title="The Princess Of Wales Visits Kirkgate Market In Leeds" width=3290 height=5308 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1675175404.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="leeds, england january 31 catherine, princess of wales departs after a tour of kirkgate market on january 31, 2023 in leeds, england photo by samir husseinwireimage" title="The Princess Of Wales Visits Kirkgate Market In Leeds" width=4696 height=7044 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1675175597.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><img alt="leeds, england january 31 catherine, princess of wales during a visit to kirkgate market on january 31, 2023 in leeds, england the princess of wales is undertaking engagements in london and leeds this week as part of the launch of a campaign to raise awareness of the unique importance of early childhood photo by anthony devlingetty images" title="The Princess Of Wales Visits Kirkgate Market In Leeds" width=3185 height=4778 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1675175616.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Along with the campaign, the Royal Foundation Centre dropped a 90-second Claymation film about a little girl named Layla as she develops from an infant to a five-year-old, highlighting how her interactions with people and her environment shape her life.

It affects everything from our ability to form relationships and thrive at work, to our mental and physical well-being as adults and the way we parent our own children," the royal said in a press release statement. "These are the most preventative years. By focusing our collective time, energy, and resources to build a supportive, nurturing world around the youngest members of our society and those caring for them, we can make a huge difference to the health and happiness of generations to come."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She concluded, "All of society has a role to play in this, even if you are not directly involved in a child’s life, because we are all responsible for building a more compassionate world in which our children can grow, learn and live. In these difficult times, it is more important than ever to help support parents and caregivers provide loving, safe and secure homes for their babies and young children to thrive."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
