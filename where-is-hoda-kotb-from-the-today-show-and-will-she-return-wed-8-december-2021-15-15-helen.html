Over the years, the show has featured a variety of presenters. Past news anchors have included Matt Lauer and Katie Couric. However, the former was replaced in 2018 by Hoda Kotb. Savannah Guthrie and Hoda presented The Today Show together.</strong></p><p>In 2021, it appears that Hoda Kotb is absent from her presenting role on The Today Show alongside Jenna Bush Hager on ‘TODAY with Hoda & Jenna’. So, let’s find out more about where Hoda is and whether she’ll be back on the NBC show.</p>BridTV6825The Voice | Season 21 First Look Trailer | NBC906094906094center22403<figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=who-is-hoda-kotb>Who is Hoda Kotb?</h2><p>Hoda Kotb is an American TV journalist who has worked on NBC’s Today Show for over three years in 2021.</p><p>She was born in Oklamhoma in 1964 and is 57 years old.</p><p>Hoda has been in a relationship with Joel Schiffman since 2013 and the pair got engaged in 2019.
