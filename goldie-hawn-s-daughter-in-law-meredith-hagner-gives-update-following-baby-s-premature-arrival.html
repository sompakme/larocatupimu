The caption particularly discussed the transition women go through when they become mothers, a message she'd initially sent to a friend who had felt nervous about motherhood.</p><p id=eum9JlsBq7u data-wc=44>"When your baby [is] born, you are reborn. This time as a mother. The essence of who you are, all the magic that makes you so singularly YOU is there but she might be a stranger to you for a little while," Meredith wrote.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell become grandparents for eighth time: 'Hearts overflowing'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3b21a7036325-gettyimages-1011177192.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell become grandparents for eighth time: 'Hearts overflowing'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell become grandparents for eighth time: 'Hearts overflowing'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eOXGvlr4X2O data-wc=35>"I felt so lonely and tired in those early days", she continued. "And I wish someone had told me how normal that is, and how it’s no way indicative of the mother I would be."</p><p id=eSA1ohAWhyP data-wc=104>Meredith finished the message, saying: "Looking back if I had only looked at this time as a surreal hole in the universe and in time where time is not what it has ever been, you are not who you’ve ever been, your partner is being reborn as well so your relationship is not as it’s ever been, and to tread lightly because it’s all merely a season, and as is in all life, we will end up coming out of a season looking back and viewing it as one of the most beautiful hard poetic shocking loving soul melting heavenly hellish moments in time."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
