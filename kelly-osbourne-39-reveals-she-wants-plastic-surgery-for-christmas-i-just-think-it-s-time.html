"I think I've decided what I want for Christmas," she said, adding, "Plastic surgery," while gesturing under her chin.</p><p id=eoOqZezW0- data-wc=29>&nbsp;Ozzy immediately expressed his concern, saying, "Kelly, don't! Don't start," to which Kelly replied, "Well, I just think it's my time." Sharon, echoing her husband's sentiment, cautioned, "Too early."</p><p id=es8WM059JV_ data-wc=45>The conversation then shifted to Sharon's own experience with cosmetic surgery, with Jack asking, "How old were you when you started your journey down the road of cosmetic surgery?" Sharon replied, "Early 40s," prompting Kelly to exclaim, "Hello!" acknowledging she was nearing that age herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b3f4518119b-kelly-sharon-osbourne.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Kelly Osbourne's tiny figure in plunging dress after dramatic weight loss has to be seen to be believed" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3a829c3486b0-kelly-osbourne-birthday.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Kelly Osbourne's tiny figure in plunging dress after dramatic weight loss has to be seen to be believed" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Kelly Osbourne's tiny figure in plunging dress after dramatic weight loss has to be seen to be believed</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=exhX1e1UW1M data-wc=53>In September, Sharon opened up about a facelift she had to correct a previous procedure, saying: "There's not one part of my body that I haven't had twisted, lifted, elongated, whatever. I've been messed up many times. This last one was a kind of fix-it job from the guy that did it before."</p><p id=ey8hHsip1EW data-wc=32>Kelly, addressing her own experience with weight loss and rumors of surgery, said, "I'm not bummed out about it. I'm excited because I feel like when you're 40, you get respected more."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8d121230133b-kelly-osbourne-weight-loss.jpg><p id=eOuK5BGIk7X data-wc=61>Ozzy then reflected on aging, stating, "I'll tell you what. When you hit 40, the engine starts to get faster... it goes by so quickly. And every 10 years after that, it picks up more speed, and suddenly you're 75 and you go, 'How did I get here?' And then you start to go, I ain't got that much time left.'"</p><p id=eMACWfwmuye data-wc=21>Kelly, having previously undergone a gastric sleeve procedure, dismissed the notion that she had plastic surgery to enhance her weight loss.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoQ7McXSyf- data-wc=29>She stated: "I've never had any procedure like plastic surgery. There are things that I definitely want to do when I get older, but I'm too scared, aren't I?"&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6203b5088de2-the-osbourne-family.jpg><p id=eyyEgAL-tzD data-wc=51>Sharon jokingly responded: "Oh, she's a coward! A wuss!" Kelly continued, "I've done Botox, that's it. It's weird, because now that I've lost weight, everybody is criticizing and trying to figure out what it is that I've done, and I really just lost weight. It's just the shape of my face!"</p><p id=e-F-gRpXcYP data-wc=25>Sharon, who has also been open about her weight loss journey, talked about using Ozempic, a medication typically for type 2 diabetes, for weight loss.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d57a1dcfb233-kelly-osbourne-lips-z.jpg><p id=e6fZ3r2aqMJ data-wc=35>"People think that it's a way of cheating because you didn't work out for three hours a day, or you don't have some brilliant new trainer so you're cheating. It's not cheating," she told DailyMail.com.&nbsp;</p><p id=ew8lyDzKzTT data-wc=47>"It's just something that you choose to lose weight. So, what is the biggie? I don't get it. It's like people who have a procedure done cosmetically and then they say, 'No, it's a new cream' or 'I sleep with a silk pillow now.' Just own it."</p><p id=eDOAxFZsPyn data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
