Despite having six to twelve eyes - an obvious pair at the centre of the carapace and two to five smaller eyes on each side - scorpions do not have good eyesight.<h2>Do scorpions have 12 eyes?</h2>While modern arachnids, like scorpions and spiders, do not possess these particular otherworldly features, there is a one remarkable physical feature that some modern scorpion species do possessâ€“12 separate eyes.<h2>Do scorpions have eyeballs?</h2>Scorpions are not insects but arachnids, like spiders, and have eight legs and two main body regions, the prosoma, or cephalothorax, and the opisthosoma, or abdomen.

Set them up in dark corners and near sources of water. If you catch a scorpion, throw the trap away and set out another one in the same area, since it's likely a spot that more scorpions will be attracted to.<h2>What do scorpions hate?</h2>I figured out the two things scorpions hate most of all, lavender and cedarwood oil! Makes sense that something that is so gross would hate two things that smell so sweet! Cedarwood oil is the most important part, they HATE it, as it will kill them on the spot.<h2>Are scorpions intelligent?</h2>Scorpio. Sharp, quick and extremely savvy, Scorpios are generally considered to be one of the most (if not the most) intelligent star sign.
