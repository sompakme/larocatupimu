In the early days, Drummond detailed stories about homeschooling her four kids and living on the ranch, sharing photos and recipes along the way. A year later, she started receiving awards and recognition, and her brand grew from there.</p><p dir=ltr>Just a few years into blogging, Drummond acknowledged that her site brought in "solidly one million" dollars in gross revenue the previous year. By that time, she had book deals and even had a movie optioned, and all of that income was above and beyond the blog revenue. As <a href=#>Country Living</a> detailed, that successful blog grew into a massive empire that included not just Drummond's books, but a magazine as well as a popular show on the Food Network that debuted in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>After that, Drummond developed a marketplace and restaurant in Pawhuska affectionately called The Merc. Over time, she also developed a massive line of products sold via Walmart. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she is worth an estimated $50 million, and that's just her individual net worth. Drummond's husband Ladd runs <a href=#>the family ranch</a>, and <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>&nbsp;separately puts him in the $200 million net worth range.</p><p dir=ltr>By all accounts, the Pioneer Woman brand is still growing by leaps and bounds, and it doesn't seem as if Drummond will be stepping away from her empire anytime soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG9lZYV2e9GenGacoqq6rrvNnapmppWperi70a2fZqyYmnqxtc6nnJ6qXay8rq3NZqCsZaekv7W0jKamq51dqbWiuoyypq5lpJ22r7eO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
