Its rebelliousness and understated elegance make it a classic for women who like to be able to truly move in their eveningwear. It speaks of irreverence and non-conformity in a way that a sparkly princess dress just doesn’t.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paul Smith is a man who has long extolled the virtues of women in tailoring. After so many women started wearing his menswear pieces, he decided to launch womenswear back in 1993 – and suiting lay at its heart. Free-spirited and iconoclastic women such as Patti Smith, Charlotte Rampling and Lauren Bacall - all of whom were fans of a good suit - have always served as his muse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Back in December 2018, the British designer took it up a notch and launched a dedicated tuxedo collection just for women. The line was so successful, it was continued with a few updates added each season (although the single-breasted and double-breasted black tuxedos were so popular they remain staples).

Maybe you think it’s a bit weird for me to call it a frame around a picture, but the picture is you girls, the frame is the streamlined elegant look of a tuxedo. It shows your shape and line - and is equally as sexy as a dress that shows a lot of skin. A suit or a tux respects the body, goes in at the waist, the trousers should streamline the leg – it shows off a woman’s figure in a way that isn’t obvious.”</p><h5 class="css-1qq1axs e1ghppmw6"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Shop the Paul Smith tuxedo collection<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h5><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/paul-smith-tuxedo-double-breasted-blazer-825-1544110731.jpg alt="Paul Smith tux" title="Paul Smith tux" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-6w10ws e1ghppmw1"></h6><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-black-double-breasted-tuxedo-blazer-with-satin-details data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=1b5c6973-3287-4320-9090-44a2860cc5b0 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-black-double-breasted-tuxedo-blazer-with-satin-details data-product-url=https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-black-double-breasted-tuxedo-blazer-with-satin-details data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulsmith.com%2Fuk%2Fwomen-s-black-double-breasted-tuxedo-blazer-with-satin-details" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-media-role=1 data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=56c8214f-e57b-4b88-939b-8cb2db7d97ae data-vars-ga-gallery-id=84deec15-3cb0-4352-996f-6bd32deae3c4 class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Double-breasted blazer with silk lapels, £825</p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/paul-smith-tuxedo-parallel-trousers-with-satin-details-440-1544110730.jpg alt="Paul Smith tux" title="Paul Smith tux" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-6w10ws e1ghppmw1"></h6><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/paul-smith-tux-dress-1597243055.jpg alt="paul smith tux" title="Paul Smith tux" width=1400 height=2100 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-6w10ws e1ghppmw1"></h6><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/paul-smith-trousers-1597243055.jpg alt="paul smith tux" title="Paul Smith tux" width=1400 height=2100 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h6 class="css-6w10ws e1ghppmw1"></h6><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-classic-fit-black-tuxedo-trousers#&gid=1&pid=1" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SHOP NOW" rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-product-id=0410422b-ec32-48eb-a734-68d9264b9efe data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href="https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-classic-fit-black-tuxedo-trousers#&gid=1&pid=1" data-product-url="https://www.paulsmith.com/uk/women-s-classic-fit-black-tuxedo-trousers#&gid=1&pid=1" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X618962&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paulsmith.com%2Fuk%2Fwomen-s-classic-fit-black-tuxedo-trousers%23%26gid%3D1%26pid%3D1" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-media-role=1 data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=24dab168-e72e-407c-90ad-4f8cecf87796 data-vars-ga-gallery-id=84deec15-3cb0-4352-996f-6bd32deae3c4 class="body-btn-link product-links-button css-1xbq6k6 e1aq0z090">SHOP NOW</a></p><p class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Classic-fit black tux trousers, £400</p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">My wife was my first ever tailoring muse and teacher</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I met Pauline, my girlfriend then and wife now, when I was 21. She had studied at the RCA as a fashion designer and it was that era when how things were made were crucial; the importance of the way a sleeve is put into a jacket and the roll of a lapel… It was something I was schooled on when I met Pauline.

It was unbelievably outrageous and wasn’t well received at the time – it was so different. The model wore a silk chiffon top and a jacket – and, for the first time, you saw a bare women’s chest on the catwalk. The 20 people in the audience – the couture shows were very intimate affairs then - were shocked. Then Helmut Newton made it truly iconic with his shoot in a Parisian alleyway 1975. But it was, and still is, incredibly sexy.”</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Look to Patti Smith, Charlotte Rampling and my wife as tuxedo style heroes</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Patti Smith wears a suit well, Charlotte Rampling looks amazing in them and my wife looks fantastic in hers – she is the owner of the very last Le Smoking couture tux. Saint Laurent made her the last one, kindly reproducing the style from 1967 which is the year we met. So that was quite special, and she wears it occasionally when we’re going to something posh.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">The women’s tux is almost more relevant now than ever</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With what’s been happening with the #MeToo movement, what women wear on the red carpet is changing. I wonder if the rise in women wearing tailoring is related to the recent feminist movements - I can’t say for sure, but it’s interesting. Maybe it’s a good time for ladies to just wear something that’s elegant and beautifully made that says, ‘I’m me.’ Tuxes have a loose canvas, strong shoulders, they’re single and double breasted - this collection is proper. This isn’t a fashion tuxedo, it’s a real tuxedo which means it’s based on the construction of a couture piece.”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Women in tuxes and suits signal a certain independence</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“This is just my opinion, but tuxes worn by women seem to suggest an independence, and also a confidence of a sophisticated someone who doesn’t necessarily need to do something overtly sexy to draw attention to herself. It says that you have an interesting mind and a good conversation. Tuxes and suits are worn by women on the move, who want to get on with things. They’re not looking for a symbol or sign to say, ‘look at me, I’m sexy.’ They don’t need that extra validation. They’re just saying, ‘I am me.’”</p><img alt="laura bailey" title="Laura Bailey" width=3572 height=5358 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/laura-bailey-in-paul-smith-1597248705.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Karwai Tang</span><p>Laura Bailey in Paul Smith at the Fashion For Relief show in September 2019</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Tuxes are more versatile than you think</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I love a tux with a Fruit of the Loom T-shirt and trainers. I love a tux jacket with worn-out blue jeans. There are so many different ways you can wear it depending on the occasion and what you want to say. You can wear a tux jacket, with a vest, Levi’s 501s and Converse – that’s a fantastic look.

There’s no time to do anything anymore, so comfort is very important. Paul Smith suits, especially the tuxedo collection, have a loose canvas inside the jacket. The key word here is loose. With a lot of tailoring, the interlining will be glued to the fabric, but the traditional way is a loose canvas, which still looks beautiful, but the point is that when you move, it moves. It gives you a freedom of movement. With a glued canvas – if you lift your arm, the whole garment lifts up, because it’s fused.”</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">And don’t forget the joy of a pocket</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“As you get older, and you have your spectacles and your house keys and you don’t want to carry a bag that you might lose or that’s just in your way, then an outfit with pockets is fantastic. A bit of a lippy, a card and your keys, tucked into your pocket, and you’re off.
