Knight constantly gets cheered every week, but he is prepared for the fan reactions to eventually die down.</p><p>Last year, the former Max Dupri witnessed a significant surge in popularity, kicking off the year with the Pitch Black match at the Royal Rumble event. Throughout the year, Knight’s fanbase continued to grow steadily, enjoying robust support from the audience.</p><p>He has been constantly involved in main event storylines for the past several months and fans continue to wish the best for him. However, as is the case for every professional wrestler, fans are likely to eventually stop cheering for him as much.</p><p>While speaking&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>Chris Van Vliet of Insight</a>, LA Knight talked about the fan reactions he gets each week, expressing a mix of surprise and gratitude for the growing support. Knight also made it clear he is prepared for the fan reactions to eventually die down. However, he welcomes that challenge because he will use it to get better.</p><p>“I think every week I’m always looking at it like, man, it’s gonna slide off at some point. And you know what, when it does, I’m just gonna roll with it, and I’m gonna get even better from that point.</p><p>Because at that point, I’m out, and you’re all getting jabbed. But no, I don’t know; at this point, it’s just been growing and growing. And I remember the very first time I think we talked about it last time it was, it was in DC in March.”</p><p>And from there, it was like, oh, okay, now we’re starting to get somewhere. And then it was like, more and more, and that wasn’t necessarily the reaction I was looking for. Because especially coming out of the Bray Wyatt thing, it’s like, Alright, let me keep getting heat. Let me keep getting heat.”</p><p>WWE was also worried&nbsp;<a href=#>that LA Knight would be flash in the pan</a>. LA Knight is set to square off against Roman Reigns, AJ Styles, and Randy Orton for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at the Royal Rumble Premium Live Event on January 27th. We will have to wait and see whether Knight will end up winning the match this month.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your view on what LA Knight said?
