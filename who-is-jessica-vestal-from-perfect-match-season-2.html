It seems possible that issue, which remains unsettled, will add more road bumps in the couple's pairing on the way to the Perfect Match season 2 finale on June 21.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2TwWdaB9pKZVSqNtfVtLb-1920-80.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Vestal has spoken out in interviews since Perfect Match premiered about her relationship with Jowsey—and she seems to have only kind things to say.

She also addressed his reputation, saying, "At that point in time, based on my experience with him, I had no reason not to believe what he was telling me."</p><p>"I would consider Harry a veteran in the reality TV space," she told the outlet. "There were a lot of situations I was really uncomfortable in, and Harry was my comfort zone.

Jowsey didn't reveal the person's name, the timing may align with the Perfect Match production schedule.
