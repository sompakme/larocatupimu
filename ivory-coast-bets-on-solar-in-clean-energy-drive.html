beats down from a cloudless sky on the town of Boundiali, where Ivory Coast's first solar power plant embodies the drive to embrace clean <a href=#>energy</a> without abandoning fossil fuels.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike the wetter, cloudier south, the climate in northern Ivory Coast bordering Burkina Faso and Mali is hot and dry for around eight months of the year.</p><p class=align-left>"Irradiance is very high" in the region, plant engineer Franck Alain Yayo told AFP, referring to the intensity of the Sun's energy.</p><p class=align-left>The Boundiali plant, which opened in June 2023, aims to improve the electricity supply to more than 430,000 households, the energy ministry said.</p><p class=align-left>Although Ivory Coast has about 10 smaller solar power plants serving villages at a local level, Boundiali is the first on the national grid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

sources by 2030.</p><p class=align-left>The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that half the population of sub-Saharan <a href=#>Africa</a> has no access to electricity.</p><p class=align-left>And yet, it added in a recent report: "Africa is home to 60 percent of the best solar resources globally, yet only one percent of installed solar PV (photovoltaic) capacity."</p><p class=align-left>While the continent has doubled its capacity to produce clean energy in the last 10 years, African renewables still account for just two percent of global capacity.</p><h2>Call for private funding</h2><p class=align-left>The northern Ivorian town has some 68,000 solar panels bought from China laid out in rows across 36 hectares (89 acres).</p><p class=align-left>The panels convert sunlight, not heat, into electricity.</p><p class=align-left>By the end of next year, the aim is to have twice as many panels to reach a production capacity of 80 MWp (Megawatt peak, a measure of the maximum potential output).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center

financed by Ivory Coast, a German loan and a European Union grant.</p><p class=align-left>"This is the result of the EU's long-standing commitment to the renewable energy sector, with almost 140 million euros since 2017," EU ambassador to Ivory Coast Francesca Di Mauro told AFP.</p><p class=align-left>However, international public funding to support sub-Saharan Africa's transition towards clean energy will not be enough.</p><p class=align-left>Last year, the IEA called for private investment to be stepped up to account for 60 percent of financing.</p><p class=align-left>Solar power is currently a small part of the Ivorian energy mix -- the Boundiali plant contributes just one percent of national production.</p><p class=align-left>Nearly 70 percent of the country's electricity comes from gas-fired thermal power plants, while hydroelectric power stations account for the rest, all located in the south.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px

greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent.</p><p class=align-left>Fossil fuels however still play a key role.</p><h2>New oil, gas discoveries</h2><p class=align-left>The West African nation recently discovered two huge oil and natural gas deposits.</p><p class=align-left>One of them, the Calao field, "will eventually meet the country's electricity production needs", said Energy Minister Sangafowa Coulibaly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/46b6ad5bc040c73f.jpg><p class=align-left>It may also help reduce electricity bills, which would be a welcome relief to householders after prices rose by 10 percent in January.</p><p class=align-left>"Every day the sun shines on our heads" the cost of production is "very low", plant engineer Yayo said.</p><p class=align-left>Yayo, who learned his skills in Burkina Faso, regretted that his country had neither the technology nor the expertise to train people.</p><p class=align-left>Ivory Coast's state-run company CI-Energies, which handles Boundiali plant's infrastructure, temporarily subcontracts to French civil
