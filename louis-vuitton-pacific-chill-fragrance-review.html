Maybe it's the beach. Whatever the appeal, Los Angeles has attracted many looking for an idyllic place to set roots. As a born-and-raised L.A. native, I can confirm that my hometown is a very special place that is much more than its Hollywood scene. And recently, the relaxed and calm vibes, warm coastal weather, and dedication to a holistic and healthy lifestyle have led French luxury house Louis Vuitton to celebrate all things L.A. with its newest fragrance, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pacific Chill</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Created by the brand's master perfumer, Jacques Cavallier Belletrud, Pacific Chill is the fifth fragrance in a collection dedicated to California. Dubbed "the wellness fragrance" of the group, Pacific Chill is a crisp, citrusy scent imbued with notes of carrot seed essence, blackcurrant, orange, mint, and basil â€” all of which are balanced by the sweetness of apricot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a single spritz, its bright, earthy scent awakens the senses, which was Belletrud's goal. "I think about notes that make you smile," Belletrud tells InStyle. "At least, I try to."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The inspiration for the scent lies in green smoothies. Belletrud recalls meeting with his frequent Louis Vuitton collaborator, multimedia artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Alex Israel</a>, to talk about their next project together. In what can only be described as "so L.A.," they ended up talking about Belletrud's latest love for the healthy vegetable-based drink, which has had a lasting grip on the city of angels.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Alex asked me, 'What is your inspiration in LA?' I say, 'Well, I'm drinking the same carrot and orange smoothie for three days and I love it," says Belletrud. "I love the texture and the taste; it gives me a lot of energy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrot is the fragrance's most interesting note, Belletrud explains, since it's hard to find in other scents. Instead of using the vegetable itself to get that soft, fruity-wood smell, however, he chose to use distilled carrot seed oil before balancing it out with the apricot, basil, and other green notes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After all, there are no rules when it comes to fragrance. Trying to piece together what scents work together when layering or trying to pick a signature smell shouldn't be complicated or methodical at all. You should just feel your way through it. "To choose a perfume is a way of connecting with yourself," Belleturd says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And Pacific Chill does just that. While it's sweeter than expected and has a powerful opening, it dries down to a lovely blend of warm, lush, yet fresh notes that lasts all day long. It's proof that even if green juice isn't your thing, spritzing on a scent that makes you feel good can still be part of your wellness routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Let's not forget the packaging, either: To match the tone of the fragrance, Israel designed a classic LA beach landscape on the leather case that houses it. With light blue skies and palm trees, the visual captures the calmness and connection to nature.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While I've been in New York City for nine years (and counting), whenever my heart yearns for the Malibu ocean breeze or I just miss my mom, I mist this on to have a little piece of home with me wherever I go.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Splurge</a>&nbsp;is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are worth it.
