Earlier today she posted some more of her ongoing chart accomplishments on her IG story. Tacked onto the end of the series post is a pic of her paying tribute to reality star Natalie Nunn. The picture is paired perfectly with the track "Endless Fashion" from <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Uzi Vert</a>'s new album Pink Tape. On the track, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> makes a hilarious lyrical reference to Nunn that had fans rolling when they listened to it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is just another association between Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice. Earlier this year the pair linked up for a remix of Ice Spice's song "Princess Diana." That song managed to debut inside the top 10 of the Hot 100. This week the pair linked up once again for the new song "Barbie World." This track is attached to the upcoming Greta Gerwig-directed Barbie movie. Earlier today the song once again debuted in the top 10 of the Hot 100. It's the 4th top 10 hit of the year so far for Spice following "Karma" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a> and "boys a liar pt. 2" with Pink pantheress.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-s-instagram-story-shoutout>Ice Spice's Instagram Story Shoutout</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It wasn't even the only controversy Ice Spice sparked that night. Earlier during the show itself <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">someone caught her on her phone</a> during another artist's performance. The video sparked a debate between fans about whether she should be paying attention to the other performers during the show. What do you think of Ice Spice shouting out Natalie Nunn?
