The Indiana-born artist has been making waves ever since 2020 during the worst part of the pandemic. While it took a little bit of time for listeners to get wind of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">midwxst's music</a>, people are starting to realize what he can bring to the table. His debut album, E3, is a rollercoaster that takes you through the sounds of hip-hop, pop, rock, hyperpop, and emo rap. Honestly, there could be more we are forgetting because midwxst really tries so many different things.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It is one thing to try, but he succeeds here. Furthermore, what is more impressive is that there are no features either. It is just midwxst, his raw emotion, and the production, in which he had a big hand in too. It is 12 tracks and runs around 34 minutes. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Midwxst shared</a> a lot of details on this project as well.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-e3-from-midwxst>Listen To E3 From Midwxst</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to Genius, midwxst says this has been in the works ever since he was 17 years old. "This album rollout has been in my head since I was 17. I have a full notepad in my phone with the script for the interludes on the project and the ideas that eventually became ‘E3.’" He continues to say, "The album is an emotional journey through the mistakes I’ve made as a person and that ‘E3,’ the protagonist of the story, is constantly facing and having to finally come to terms with." Those ideas do ring true throughout with songs like "old me," "lost," and so many others. This album is worth a serious listen, as midwxst has something special brewing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand new album, E3, from midwxst?
