He reportedly told Mr Brackley he fainted behind the wheel.</p><p>DTL Timbers, the driver’s company, told 7News Adelaide he had a medical episode behind the wheel and sustained minor injuries in the incident. A spokesman said he was “still trying to recall what happened” but was “really grateful that nobody was injured in any way, shape or form”.</p><p>That sentiment was echoed by South Australian Police Minister Joe Szakcas.</p><p>“(For a) massive, heavy truck take out that infrastructure and come so close to homes is really scary, and I’m just really thankful this wasn’t worse than it was,” he told 9News.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Mr Brackley said it was “miraculous no one was killed” on the road, footpath, or front yards when the truck barrelled down the usually-busy Hampstead Road – which is part of a major arterial route through the eastern suburbs of Adelaide.</p><p>“The truck was making a hell of a noise when I got there and I was thinking, could it blow up? Or what could happen?” Mr Brackley said.</p><p>The collision impacted gas and water lines in the area, and days later residents are still faced with a massive clean-up on their hands.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7056aoaafobyoxY6mpq2nop67qHvOp2StoJViv7Ctw2irq62ToHq0ucCsn56rXam1s7vUoJ9mmZSauaK1w55km62jYsC1u89moKdlpJq%2Fs7XFsqCnn12ZrrS0wpqkZq6ZmbKwe82erqxlo6m8s8WOmp1wm2hrg6SCkmuZbmhjZoV1g8FwnJ5vYWawcrHCnGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
