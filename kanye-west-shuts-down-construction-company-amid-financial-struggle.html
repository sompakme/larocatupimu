While he's up to other endeavors these days like his <a href=# rel>Yeezy fashion shows</a>, his pockets don't seem to run as deep as they used to. Moreover, AllHipHop reports that the Chicago native shut down his construction company, <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a> Construction, Inc. What's more is that he actually had at least one major project on the horizon when it came to property. However, it seems like that goal is unattainable at the moment.</p><p>Furthermore, he planned to renovate <a href=# rel>his $57 million Malibu property</a> and customize it as he saw fit. To elaborate, Kanye West basically rendered the home skeletal as he sought to add new windows and invest in making it his own. Back in November of 2022, reports emerged that the 45-year-old halted said process because of his worsening financials and business relationships.

For example, recent reports indicated that Adidas did, in fact, <a href=# rel>freeze Kanye West's account</a> totaling close to $100 million as he previously claimed. While they agreed to <a href=# rel>sell the remainder of unsold Yeezy stock</a>, it's clear the brand wants to officially terminate the relationship as soon as possible. In addition, they announced that <a href=# rel>most of the proceeds</a> will go to the Anti-Defamation League, a leading voice against antisemitism, and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change dedicated to the life of George Floyd and justice for marginalized communities.</p><p>Meanwhile, as <a href=# rel>new Yeezy colorways and designs hit the Internet</a>, fans wonder just how much money this will net the multi-hyphenate. Also, debate surely sprouted among many fans on whether they would support this decision. Regardless of how it pans out, it will be very interesting to see how this business deal comes to a close- and how much stakeholders and the company leaders themselves will benefit from it.
