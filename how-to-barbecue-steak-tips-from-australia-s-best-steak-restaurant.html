Scotch fillets are usually sliced more thinly — about 2cm — so they can be left in the fridge until you’re ready to pop them on the barbecue (this is will help prevent them from overcooking).</p><p>■ Always clean the barbecue before using it. Fire up the grill, scrub it with a wire brush to release any nasty leftovers from the last time it was used, then rub it down with a damp tea towel or cloth to remove any grease. Put the lid down, so it heats up.</p><p>■ Now, go and grab a beer while you wait for the barbecue to heat up. It will take around 15-20 minutes on the highest setting to get nice and hot. Then you’re ready to rock and roll.</p><p>■ Home-bought steaks will benefit from being seasoned with salt and pepper. Using sea salt will help achieve a nice crust. Season both sides of your steaks and spray with a little canola oil (alternatively you could spray the grill with the oil).</p><p>■ Place your steaks in the centre of the grill. A 2cm-thick scotch fillet will take approximately 1.5 minutes on each side, with two minutes resting time, to cook to medium rare. Leave it on the grill for two minutes either side, if you want to cook it to medium.</p><p>■ A thicker T-bone will take at least three to four minutes each side, with five to six minutes resting time, to cook to medium rare. Cook it for about five minutes either side, with approximately 10 minutes resting time for medium.</p><p>■ To achieve a crisscrossed effect on your steak, put it down on the hotplate at a 90-degree angle and cook for about 45 seconds, lift the steak and turn it a further 90-degrees before putting it back down in a new cooking spot (if you return it to the same spot the grill will take longer to heat back up). Cook for the required time before turning to cook the other side.</p><p><b>Read more</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=#>10 healthy recipes for a weekend barbecue</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=#>Recipe: Open face steak sandwich</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=#>How much meat should we eat?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme8Wopp1nlZbBcLTOsGStp12XrrOuxJysnmWknbJuvMSrnZ6bpGLAtbHApGannaeoerTAzquwaJ1gboOngZhvmXBvkW2zeIGScJlsnGZlgXWtxW5rm2po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
