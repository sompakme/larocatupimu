This time, the writer and director who has become a fan favorite for his creepy, bone-chilling miniseries draws inspiration from Edgar Allan Poe, in eight episodes filled with jaw-dropping, horrific scenes as well as a surprising amount of pop culture references for a Flanaverse show. Adapted from Poe's short story of the same name and filled with details from Poe's other works, The Fall of the House of Usher follows the ruthless duo of Roderick (Bruce Greenwood) and Madeline Usher (Mary McConnell), a pair of siblings who have built Fortunato Pharmaceuticals into a wealthy empire (as well as a leading figure in the show universe's opioid pandemic—there's not many degrees of separation between the Ushers and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/painkiller-true-story-netflix/>the Sacklers</a>). When each of Roderick's children begin to die in a series of tragic events, the corrupt CEO must reckon with the secrets of his past, as well as the reappearance of a mysterious woman (Carla Gugino).</p><p>As is "Flanaverse" tradition, several of Flanagan's frequent collaborators have returned to fill out this troubled, dysfunctional family which makes the Roys look like the Brady Bunch. In addition to many familiar faces from shows like The Haunting of Hill House and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/midnight-club-cast-netflix/#section-the-hospice>The Midnight Club</a>, the show also brings on several award-winning veteran actors, including a living sci-fi legend.
