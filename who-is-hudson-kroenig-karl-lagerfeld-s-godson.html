His right-hand woman, Virginie Viard, his over-the-top kitty cat, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Choupette</a>, and his favorite runway companion, Hudson Kroenig, are all getting a bit of attention, but who exactly is the pint-sized model that walked with "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Uncle Karl</a>" at so many Chanel fashion shows? The tiny tot is the son of model Brad Kroenig, one of Lagerfeld's favorite male models.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Brad and Lagerfeld met on the set of a shoot for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>V Man</a> and he subsequently became a muse to the designer. He was one of Lagerfeld's favorites, so much so that the designer dedicated an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>entire book to photographs</a> of him. Brad was so appreciative of the way that Lagerfeld fostered his career that when he had a son in 2009, he asked Lagerfeld to be the kiddo's godfather. It was an honor that Karl took to immediately.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Times</a> Lagerfeld said that since he had no sons of his own, he treated his favorite models and Hudson like family.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I see the boys like family. I have no family at all," he said. "So it's good to have, like, sons, but without the unpleasant problems sons can create."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike his famous dad, Hudson's mom stays away from the spotlight. According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daily Mail</a>, the family lives in the United States, but Karl often invites Hudson and his father to far-off locales for Chanel shows. In his debut, he walked hand-in-hand with his dad in custom-made Chanel outfits and in subsequent shows, Hudson's walked out with Karl himself during his final bow.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Stefanie Keenan/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But it's not just fashion shows — Hudson's also appeared in Lagerfeld's book celebrating Chanel's famed jacket, Little Black Jacket, as well as editorial spreads in W Magazine and German Vogue. With a résumé that rivals the full-grown models on the runway, not to mention his pedigree, it's clear that Hudson's got what it takes to make it big in fashion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeYqrG0u81moqunlaO2qHnKmqmlZZyWtKa%2BxZ6jnWWXpLG0u80%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
