His four-decade-long wrestling career included a period when he was regarded as one of the sport’s most revered and beloved icons. Jim Cornette recently revealed how Hogan got his black eye at WrestleMania IX.</p><p><a href=#>Mr. Fuji threw salt in Bret Hart</a>‘s eyes and assisted Yokozuna in winning the WWE Championship at WrestleMania IX. When the bell rung, Hulk Hogan—who was at the time perhaps the biggest babyface in the business—came to the ring to see how “The Hitman” was doing. Fuji issued a challenge to Hogan on behalf of Yokozuna to engage the champion in a quick match for the title.</p><p>Hogan would accept the match. When the bell rung, <a href=#>Fuji attempted to strike Yokozuna instead of Hogan</a> by throwing salt in his eyes like he had done to Hart. Fuji made a mistake, which gave Hogan the opportunity to pin Yokozuna in under 30 seconds and capture the belt in one of the most contentious finishes in the “Showcase of the Immortals” lore.</p><p>Hogan’s black eye was clearly visible as he celebrated winning the belt. Hogan stated that the injury occurred while he was riding a jet ski with Brutus “The Barber” Beefcake in an <a href=#>interview with Michael “The Voice” Schiavello</a>. Beefcake allegedly urged Hogan to get on his ski when they stopped for gas.</p><p>I jumped on his ski, and the first wave I jumped over it nosed on me, so it threw me over the front of the ski, and I had a lifejacket on, so I tried to duck down in the water, but the lifejacket brought me up, and the ski hit me in the face. It broke my orbital socket.</p><p>Jim Cornette revealed that Hogan’s story is untrue and that Randy Savage, another WWE Hall of Famer, is really to blame for Hogan’s shiner. Cornette said on episode 179 of “<a href=#>Jim Cornette’s Drive Thru</a>” that Savage confronted him by punching him in the eye.</p><p>Savage found out that Elizabeth had run off to Hogan’s house and was staying with Linda [Hulk Hogan’s ex-wife] because Linda and Elizabeth were friends, and Hogan didn’t tell Savage that she was there, which is why when Savage confronted him with that, he confronted him by punching him in the f-cking eye, and that’s why Hogan had a black eye at WrestleMania IX.</p><p>Hulk Hogan is also no stranger to controversy, even excluding the racist remarks. Earlier this year, the Hulkster made headlines after implying that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">vaccines probably had something to do with the deaths</a>&nbsp;of Betty White and Sidney Poitier.
