"We're going to do it again." During her first round, only 10 of her 15 eggs were viable. However, those 10 had some complications and only three eggs made it to the end of the process.&nbsp;</p><p>But, unfortunately for&nbsp;Fitzgerald and her husband&nbsp;Romain Bonnet, the last three eggs were not healthy and had several abnormalities&nbsp;which made them unviable options.&nbsp;"We want to wait for a couple more years," she confessed to&nbsp;Bristowe. "He wants to wait ... I want to wait, but we may not have that opportunity because ... I feel so young and I'm not."&nbsp;Fitzgerald has since been encouraging women on social media to go through the&nbsp;embryo freezing process at a younger age and not wait for the last minute. "Please consider doing this at the youngest age possible if you know/think you want to have children," the real-estate agent said in an <a href=#>Instagram</a> video.&nbsp;</p><p>During a January 2021 interview with <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>,&nbsp;Fitzgerald — who already has adult son from a previous relationship&nbsp;— added that she is trying to have a child with Bonnet because she doesn't want to rob him from that experience. "I don't care about having kids anymore," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcm1haYJye9Keo6Whnpx6tMHNrJytq12irrPFjJ%2BgrbKXmr%2BiuMNmnqKulah6tK3DZqypnJGpsm67zWafnqpdnsOnecmorKumla58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
