Jordan's world, we're just living in it. In recent weeks, the Black Panther actor's name has been making headlines thanks to various impressive efforts on his part. Just last month he exciting job of hosting on Saturday Night Live, and his opening monologue certainly didn't disappoint. At the time, he addressed his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">breakup from Lori Harvey</a>, which shocked fans of the couple in mid-2022.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Aside from that, the 36-year-old star is gearing up for his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">directorial debut, Creed III</a> to hit theatres. The film is set to release on Friday (March 3), alongside a fire soundtrack executive produced by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">J. Cole and his Dreamville crew</a>. For the past few days Jordan has been attending red carpets and giving interviews about his upcoming project, as well as the racy Calvin Klein photoshoot he just dropped.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-michael-s-mom-knows-he-s-got-it-going-on>Michael's Mom Knows He's Got It Going On</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Monday (February 27), a collection of black and white images showing the California native's chisled body in various pairs of CK underwear made their debut. As expected, it wasn't long before <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">thirsty replies</a> began pouring in, chiefly on Twitter. From propositioning the actor for sexual favours to admitting to excessively zooming in on the images, users didn't hold back when revealing their freaky fantasies abut Jordan.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While chatting with Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet, the multi-talent admitted that he gave his mom, Donna Jordan, an apology before the NSFW images went public. "I was like, my mama&nbsp;gon’ have to see this. Let me call her and be like, ‘I’m sorry. It’s out here.' My business all out in the streets — literally,” he joked. Regardless if his family matriarch approves or not, the reactions prove that Jordan is one step closer to beating those <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"corny" allegations</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Creed III is Around the Corner</h2></span><p>Jonathan Majors and Michael B.

Specifically, he mentioned the possibility of "a spin-off of the TV show, the animation or graphic novel, or a video game."
