Moreover, this last phenomenon is due to a clip of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Justin Bieber</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jaden Smith</a> embracing at the festival. In the video below, you can see the former hug the latter from behind and sway around dancing, and then the Canadian superstar lands a kiss on his friend's cheek. Of course, this led to a lot of pause-core reactions from users in the comments section below, many of which simply made fun of an innocuous public display of affection.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For example, here are some standouts: "That white n***a in front them looking like he can’t believe his own 2 eyes," "i don’t care what anybody says i don’t just kiss my boys on the cheek every time i leave," and "Why everyone moving gay now? Is it the new trend???" Sure, it's a pretty suggestive and odd interaction, but more so because of the public TMI nature of it, not the act itself. However, others commenting on Jaden Smith's hug drew a connection to Justin Bieber's ties to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> amid <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his sex trafficking scandal</a>, which has also elicited a lot of sexuality discussions. "Look what diddy done did to him lmfaooo," one user wrote.</p><span></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For those unaware, Jaden Smith and Justin Bieber have a pretty public and tight relationship as friends, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">going on tour together</a> and performing multiple times across their careers. They've never really done much beforehand to elicit this type of reactions from social media users, though. Regardless of the nature of their intimacy or how they view it, it's also just impossible to make a judgement call on this without knowing these people. Don't we all know of some weird physical bond between two of our friends that's hard to explain to others? Maybe we're just digging the grave further at this point...</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Regardless, raising these eyebrows in a way that mostly puts homosexuality down is not the way to speak on what's simply somewhat cringe-inducing PDA between two pals. Also, they're both <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">very much taken right now</a>, so maybe that's what should be at the forefront of reactors' minds.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbYR4gZZmoa6rpJ67bq7Inpmeql2frqWxzWaqpqGknXqku8Ccn56knJZ6qbXPZp%2BoqF2jsri%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
