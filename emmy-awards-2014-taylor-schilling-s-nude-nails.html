The perfect nude to complement <a href=#>Schilling’s beaded taupe-y and silver metallic gown by Zuhair Murad</a>. “She was really vocal — she had a point of view. She said, ‘I know I want to do a nude, but picking the right nude will be the challenge,’ ” says Saunders, who pulled together a selection of matte, sheer and cream options. “She immediately went for this <a href=# rel=nofollow>Essie color called Cocktails and Coconuts</a>,” she says. “She said it was the perfect color. I put two coats on her hands and toes, and it went so well with her jewelry and handbag. She said she felt so pretty.”</p><p>Schilling also had a big say in the length and shape of her nails. “She asked me to go as short as possible, and she likes her natural soft, rounded shape,” says Saunders, who has worked with <strong>Michelle Dockery</strong> and <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>&nbsp;in the past.</p><p>Yes, nude might seem ubiquitous on the red carpet, but, says Saunders, “sometimes it’s really the only choice that you have to go with when you’re wearing an elegant dress.” For Schilling in this particular scenario,” she wanted to feel more like an icy cool goddess. But had she gone retro with the hair, then we would have done a vampy nail,” explains Saunders.</p><p>Bottom line: “If you don’t have an opaque nude in your medicine cabinet for 2014, you’ve missed out. It’s going to be around for a while.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnqSmsV2WxKK%2Bw6xka2hhaXq1rdilpqtlo5i1qrjLoqWgq11sf3iEk29m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
