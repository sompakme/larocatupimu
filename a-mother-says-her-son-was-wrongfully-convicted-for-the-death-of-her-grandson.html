He was found guilty of killing his son by a jury in rock island county. Now,&nbsp;his case is being reviewed.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s been years since Lyrik Phillips has been gone.&nbsp;But his grandmother Joanne won’t ever forget him.<br>Not being able to see her grandchild,&nbsp;and her son being locked up,&nbsp;its been a daily terror.</p><p>“It feels like a nightmare that ‘ve never waken up from even right till this day like im still in a nightmare. And the only hope is my prayer. I’m a prayer woman. I’ve raised all my children to be prayer children. They’re all great children,” says grandmother Joanne Edwards.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Joanne and her son, John, are determined to fight for justice.</p><p>“At this point i want the question marks to be eliminated. There’s just too many questions marks. It’s detectives job to solve a murder. To make sure they know who they’re sending to prison. In this case that just didn’t happen,” says John Phillips, brother of Demetrius Phillips.</p><p>Court documents state that Phillips was arrested after making a confession.&nbsp;One he later took back.</p><p>“He loved his child. It was his first son. I mean he loved him, he adored him,” says Joanne.</p><p>State’s Attorney, John McGehee, says the prosecutor used that statement heavily,&nbsp;which he says the Appellate Court saw as unnecessary.</p><p>“The appellate court reversed. And they determined that the trial court had not properly ordered a motion to suppress his statement,” says McGehee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>McGehee says they took into account the allegations by the defense that Phillips was forced to make a statement.&nbsp;<br>The Phillips family is focusing on medical evidence they say prosecutors overlooked.</p><p>“At birth when he was delivered pulled from the womb he was emergency rushed to another hospital for that spinal nerve,” shares Phillips.&nbsp;</p><p>Phillips says that spinal nerve and other at birth complications could be what ultimately killed Lyrik Phillips.</p><p>“We’re going to be taking a look at all of the information and then making a determination where we go. What happened now is that this case has come back and we have to start over with the evidence,” says State’s Attorney McGehee.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s something Joanne and her family are looking forward to.&nbsp;</p><p>“What they didn’t have was a mother like me fighting. I’m not going to stop fighting.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46aZKanpJ2ys3nSmrCsZZiav26%2FzqdksJmjYsSzu82gna6knK56pLvNr6CcrJWZeqe70WaroZ1dmbKiwMdmpp9lmJq%2FbrPRmqWdq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
