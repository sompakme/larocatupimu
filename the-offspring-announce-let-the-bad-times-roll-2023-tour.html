It’s going to be great!” said Dexter Holland of The Offspring<br></p><p>“We couldn’t be more excited to get back on tour all across the US with our friends The Offspring and Sum 41! We had such a blast touring with both of them last year that we just had to do it again and put together what we feel will be one of the most awesome tours of the summer. There’s nothing like going to see a show outside on a perfect summer night, and we hope our fans will join us and enjoy this really special show. See you there!” said Chuck Comeau of Simple Plan.<br></p><p>“We’re so excited to be back touring the States with The Offspring and Simple Plan this summer!” said Deryck Whibley of Sum 41. “There’s nothing better than hitting the road with your friends, and we can’t wait to bring the tour to you – see you soon!”<br></p><p>Frequently regarded as one of the best rock bands of all time, The Offspring have garnered a reputation for their unmistakable sound and social comment. The multi-platinum band first achieved worldwide success in the 90’s with the release of their album Smash, which sold over 11 million copies. Following Smash, they continued to release hit after hit, popularizing rock at a mainstream level. The group is also currently working on new music.<br></p><p>Throughout their career, they’ve sold over a staggering 40 million albums, and toured arenas, and built a global fan base. Let the Bad Times Roll marks the band’s tenth studio album and third album produced by the legendary Bob Rock. True to the irreverence at the core of their rock music, the band and lyricist Dexter Holland took a view to today’s cultural moments and didn’t shy away from creating topical material in this album.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>TICKETS:&nbsp; </strong>Tickets will be available starting with Citi presales on Tuesday, March 21.

Originally formed under the name Manic Subsidal, the band’s lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bryan “Dexter” Holland, bassist Todd Morse and lead guitarist Kevin “Noodles” Wasserman. Over the course of their 38-year career, they have released ten studio albums. The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California bands Green Day and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling rock bands in history.<br></p><p><strong>ABOUT SIMPLE PLAN</strong></p><p>From their new millennium rise to MTV superstardom through pop-punk’s modern resurgence, SIMPLE PLAN have been an indelible part of pop culture since forming in Montreal in 1999. They’ve sold 10 million albums worldwide, won multiple Juno Awards, performed at the 2010 Winter Olympics – and, most recently, launched the omnipresent #ImJustAKid TikTok challenge that’s spawned more than 3.4 million videos, including clips from Hilary Duff, Ed Sheeran, Usher and Venus and Serena Williams. But most importantly, they’ve never lost connection with what really matters: their audience.&nbsp;<br></p><p>That ambition is fully on display on the band’s sixth studio album, HARDER THAN IT LOOKS. The first self-released album from Comeau, vocalist Pierre Bouvier and guitarists Sébastien Lefebvre and Jeff Stinco, the album respects Simple Plan’s storied career while pushing forward in new ways, with songs like “The Antidote,” “Ruin My Life” (ft. Deryck Whibley),“Congratulations,” “Wake Me Up (When This Nightmare’s Over)” and “Iconic” set to stand as fan favorites for years to come.<br></p><p><strong>ABOUT SUM 41</strong></p><p>Looking back at the band’s storied 27-year career with over 15 million records sold worldwide, multiple Billboard Charting releases, a Grammy Award nomination, 2 Juno Awards (7 nominations), a Kerrang! Award in 2002, and multiple Alternative Press Music Awards, Sum 41 is still at the top of their game. Vocalist Deryck Whibley shas hared that the band’s new double album, titled Heaven and Hell, is shaping up to be the most ambitious of their career – half of the album brings Sum 41 back to their pop punk roots, Heaven, and half of the album is strictly metal, Hell.<br></p><p><strong>About Live Nation Entertainment</strong></p><p>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
