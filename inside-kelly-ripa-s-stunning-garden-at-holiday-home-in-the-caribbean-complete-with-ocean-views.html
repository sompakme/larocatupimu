The 49-year-old TV host admitted that she was still cutting her family's hair because she was nervous about returning to a salon. "Joaquin has my hair, everyone else in the family has Mark's hair," she said. "Their hair is bone straight, it's shiny, it's easy to cut, it just sort of lays the right way. Joaquin and I have the same head of hair. That's to say it's wirey, it's thick, it's dense, it's got lots of layers, he's got cowlicks. So it's not the easiest hair to cut." Observing her skills, Kelly said: "I think I have a future in $500 haircuts. I cut my hand in three pieces, I did not realise I was bleeding all over the place."</p><p id=ejDTN-xidrsj data-wc=1><strong>READ: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Lopez's daughter Emme reveals she's a 'proud aunty' in cute photo with new puppy</a></p><p id=e-J8qEEDEgBD data-wc=83>The star showed the haircut in a time lapse video, and Ryan was just as impressed. "You could get a lot of customers with that speed," he joked. "In that high-speed video you look like you really know what you're doing." Joaquin also spoke about his haircut, telling viewers: "She did a really good job. I'm really happy, I feel much more aerodynamic now. The only thing is I turn on my phone and I have the FaceID, and it doesn't recognise me."</p><p id=esHOaWNUlWfX data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
