Speaking at People’s Styling Princess Diana panel, Emanuel said that she knew in that moment that her “life was going to change”—but first, she had to find an excuse to leave her client, who she was doing a fitting with when the call from Diana came.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wFAhtLCkAzXc6nSwARpLgV-1920-80.jpg><p>“The phone started to ring, and it rang and rang, and nobody was picking it up,” Emanuel said. “I said, ‘I’m so sorry, I’m just going to have to take this call.’ And it was Diana. And she said, ‘It’s me,’ you know? ‘Would you do me the honor of making my wedding dress? You can’t tell anybody about this, there’s not going to be an announcement, so you’ve got to keep it very secret.’”</p><p>Of that moment, Emanuel recalled “It was such a special moment because I thought, ‘My life was going to change, David’s life—it’s never going to be the same again.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zbMu4bHaagsn4S2fk5Yt8a-1920-80.jpg><p>Naturally, Emanuel wanted to tell her team immediately, but she still had that other client there, waiting on her. She fumbled for the perfect excuse &nbsp;and finally came up with one: “My brother had a baby,” she fibbed.</p><p>Emanuel added during the panel that Diana didn’t “have any idea” about what she wanted when it came to a wedding dress. Emanuel said she did “lots and lots of sketches” and had Diana try on some ready-to-wear dresses, including one that became the template for the final product.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of it was trust, and she liked our style,” Emanuel said.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
