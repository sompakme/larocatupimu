The <a class=hm-link href=#>One Direction</a> singer wore a cast on his right foot during the band's performance in Montreal, Canada on Saturday night, where he admitted he had no idea how he had sustained the injury.</p><p id=eB3TGlcOlwl7E data-wc=47>"I woke up before the show the other day and I had a pain in my foot," he told bandmate Louis Tomlinson in a video posted online. <strong>"Then I went to get an X-ray today and I've got a fractured right foot and I don't know how."</strong></p><p id=eb5X02jEpJXp4 data-wc=26>The 21-year-old has since shared a photo of his injured foot on Instagram on Sunday, as he enjoyed a spot of sunbathing without his cast on.</p><p id=e-Q1jUYiJ6OJP data-wc=10>"Boot off chilling," he told his 11.2 million Instagram followers.</p><p id=ely9VOMGJyO27 data-wc=59>Niall's injury comes just two months after he said he had finally recovered following knee surgery in January 2014. Posting a picture of his leg bent behind him, Niall wrote: "First time I've been able to touch my a**e with my heel since I got my operation. Sounds so dumb, but it's a big day in my head haahah!"</p><p id=eymHfTDehKet- data-wc=40>The Drag Me Down singer underwent the surgery to fix his "dodgy knees", after previously suffering torn ligaments. Fortunately for the musician, he says he's "not very daring" so hopefully won't be getting any more injuries in the near future.</p><p id=eRUFgdp0oYNfg data-wc=34>"I'm not very daring, I'm all about a gentle game of golf," he told Top of the Pops magazine. "I'm actually quite boring and probably the worst pop star that ever walked the planet."</p><p id=e6WUAhqKxotg7 data-wc=33>Niall will have more time to play his beloved golf when One Direction <a class=hm-link href=#>go on their planned hiatus</a> in 2016. Despite concerns from fans that the band were going to split up, Niall <a class=hm-link href=#>tweeted his words of reassurance</a> at the end of August.</p><p id=eXvwqf4tKrnsq data-wc=38>"Ok so lots of rumours going round," he wrote. "We are not splitting up, but we will be taking a well-earned break at some point next year. Don't worry though, we still have lots we want to achieve!"</p><p id=eNeEU83-ARxO- data-wc=30>He continued: "Can't wait for you all to hear the new music we have for you and to perform some new songs as the tour continues! Love you all xx."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbmdyaGdnhHJ8mGilopmcoXqpu9GapWaeopawtcHRnqpmnp%2BkwW67zZ5knaGimrC1tc6nZK2npad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
