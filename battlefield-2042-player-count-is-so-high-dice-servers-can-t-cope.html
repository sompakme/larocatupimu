Despite the initial disappointment of the 2021 release, Battlefield 2042 has undergone several significant updates that have bit by bit improved the overall experience. Then over the weekend Battlefield 2042 enjoyed a huge surge in players, primarily because it was free-to-play on Steam.</p><p>To put it into perspective just how big this weekend proved to be, Battlefield 2042 set a new record for its all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam; with a staggering 103,000 players logging in to play the game. This beats the original launch peak of around 101,000 concurrent players, which happened back in November 2021.</p><p>The free-to-play weekend officially ended on Monday (October 16), but remarkably the game has managed to retain a massive chunk of players, who presumably decided to buy the heavily discounted game and stick with it.</p><p></p><p>Earlier today the game once again held a concurrent player count of 96,000 players. In fact, the demand to play the game has been so unprecedented that DICE's servers simply can't cope.</p><p>Many players are simply unable to log in, instead greeted with a <a href=#>Battlefield 2042 'All Servers at Capacity' error message</a>.</p><p>Writing on X (formally Twitter) <a href=#>Battlefield's official support account</a> told fans:</p><p>"We’re aware that some of you are currently unable to log into #Battlefield2042 due to Server Capacity messages. Demand is high right now, and we’re working to improve this as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience."</p><p>It's a complete redemption arc for the game, and a fantastic sight - let's just hope it manages to retain the audience even after Modern Warfare 3 drops in November.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/rFnPPS3SDL_DZ_RucFhWNASyFxl2-5eRB0-ZZDqunB4/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy8xNjgzODg4NjI2NTc5LmpwZw alt="James Wright" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3CuwK2rpZ2WnrKtsIxrZ21qX6W5osXEq2Scp6WjwW7BzZqZpZ1dqbxuuM6goKc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
