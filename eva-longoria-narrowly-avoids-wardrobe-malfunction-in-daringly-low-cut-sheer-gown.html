"We can't get a movie every 20 years," she asserted. "So, the problem is if this movie fails people go, 'Oh, Latino stories don't work. Oh, female directors really don't cut it.'"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eTscMXSFmLm data-wc=32>Eva pointed out the disparity between opportunities given to her and her white male counterparts. <strong>"A White male can direct a $200 million film, fail and get another one.
