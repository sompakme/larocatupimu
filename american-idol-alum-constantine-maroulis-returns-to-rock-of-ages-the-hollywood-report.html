Although the show was canceled after a short run, the actor said he is proud of what the cast achieved.</p><p><strong>STORY&nbsp;<a href=#>‘American Idol’ Alum Constantine Maroulis Shines Under the Stars in Hollywood</a></strong></p><p>“Last season was a tough time for us where everything was very positive, very uplifting with Kinky Boots and Pippin and we came in sort of full force with a rock show, grabbing the girl’s throat on the artwork, but everything is all about timing,” he said. “We crushed it on the road playing for hundreds of thousands of people and came in for a short run in the biggest house on Broadway, and we had a nice couple of months.”</p><p>That setback did not slow him down. The rocker revealed that he is back in the studio working on new music, which the <a href=# id=auto-tag_american-idol data-tag=american-idol>American Idol</a> Season Four alum said will be in the rock ‘n’ roll style he loved growing up.</p><p>“I’m excited about this new material,” he teased. “I have put together a great group of guys — we are doing rock ‘n’ roll in the vein of all the stuff I grew up with — from Journey to Bon Jovi to the Goo Goo Dolls,&nbsp; Maroon 5, U2 and The Police — all influenced by that world. We are hoping to unleash that pretty soon,&nbsp;too.”</p><p>In his spare time, there are even more televised acting appearances in the works. The Bold and the Beautiful star was recently seen portraying the role of “Germ” on the crime show, &nbsp;Unforgettable, and is eyeing more opportunities in that direction, as well as more theatrical roles into 2015.</p><p>Maroulis &nbsp;added that he will continue to make appearances with his ‘80s tribute band, Jessie’s Girl, and is in discussions to present a one-night-only event in New York with several of his friends from various Broadway productions. He also hopes to take the show on the road.</p><p>“Jessie’s Girl has been an awesome experience for me. I’ve always been fascinated by the tribute band. I grew up in New Jersey where the tribute concept started when I was a kid. Clearly I have built a nice business on Broadway, but with the ‘80s bands, people have associated me with not only my&nbsp;American Idol stint, but of course, Rock of Ages,” he said. “We have been talking about expanding the show, and taking it national. I think family rock ‘n’ roll entertainment is something that is really viable out there and I think we can have a good time doing it.”</p><p>Which isn’t to say he doesn’t keep up with his fellow Idols. As the first performer on the Idol stage to perform Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and having worked with the band, Maroulis had kind words for <strong>Adam</strong> <strong>Lambert</strong>’s recent Madison Square Garden appearance.</p><p>“He’s freakishly talented. He has an instrument — frankly, like <strong>Carrie</strong> <strong>Underwood</strong>, who &nbsp;is the type of girl that can wake up in the morning and wail anything imaginable, and so can <a href=# id=auto-tag_adam-lambert data-tag=adam-lambert>Adam Lambert</a>. He has become sort of a pop icon and I just don’t think that he has gotten to do what he really wants to do yet. But how do you turn down a collaboration with [Queen]? I have done work with <strong>Brian May</strong> and all of them are great, and they have always been big fans,” he said. “I think that Adam is a great performer and capable of doing his own Madison Square Garden shows in time. Everyone knows who he is. We have a lot of fans in common and I am so happy for him.&nbsp;<span>He better call me after that!”</span></p><p><span>As for Idol, </span>Maroulis<span> said he didn’t have a great deal of time to watch the entire season, but he had praise for this year’s winner, <strong>Caleb Johnson</strong>.</span></p><p>“He’s got a presence and a voice. But one thing I’ve learned is it’s a about more than that. It’s about that hustle, and six months after the show, your plan. How is he going to turn what he did on the show into something that lasts in 10 years… What he can raise a family on with a myriad of projects,” he said.</p><p>And speaking of family, all is good for Maroulis, who calls his adorable daughter, <strong>Malena</strong>, “the boss.”</p><p>“Today was a big day for our little family. We basically were registering for Pre-K, so it’s exciting. She was very excited and her mother [<strong>Angel Reed</strong>] and I are very proud of her. She is really our life,” he said. “We met doing Rock of Ages,&nbsp;so she is the Rock of Ages baby. She is quite a little show business entertainer in the making, a smart kid with a great big family around her. We’re pretty blessed.”</p><p>Twitter: @<a href=# rel=nofollow>MicheleAmabile</a>, @<a href=# rel=nofollow>Idol_Worship</a></p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BWuqa%2ByJyYp2WZmbytecClrKZlk6S7tMDAp6uippViuqK%2Bzq6joqtdbH9zgpVrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
