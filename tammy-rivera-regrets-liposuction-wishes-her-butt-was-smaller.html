Millions of people have traveled worldwide in an effort to create the perfect body, and we see much of that in the entertainment industry and on social media. Cosmetic surgery was once a taboo topic and now it's nearly impossible to find someone who <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">hasn't had some sort of work done</a>, but not everyone is happy with the end result. Tammy Rivera revealed that she's had a nip and tuck here and there, but liposuction is one procedure that she now regrets.</p><p>Maury Phillips / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I've gotten my breasts done and I've gotten lipo in my stomach, which I never should have done," Tammy admitted. "It was the worst decision I ever made. First of all, I didn't need it. I just decided like, you know how on the bottom you have a little something. When you have a baby that little pouch just doesn't go away. I was like,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> I'm gonna suck this little pouch out</a>. By me doing that, I felt like the fat deposited in other places."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She said that she's "always been bottom heavy" but now she feels as if her body is placing the fat below her waist. Tammy has been accused of getting her butt enhanced, but she stated that's just not true. "If I could suck this sh*t out, I would. I don't have to get a BBL, I don't have to takeâ€”it's crazy, even when I go to my trainers, I say, '<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I wanna lose my butt</a>... It's just too much butt!"
