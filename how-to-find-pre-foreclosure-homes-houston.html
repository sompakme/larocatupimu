a downright steal.</span><span> Here's the lowdown:</span><span> these are homes where the owners have hit a snag with their mortgage payments,</span><span> and the bank is rumbling about taking possession.</span><span> But before you start picturing tumbleweeds blowing through abandoned living rooms,</span><span> hold your horses!</span><span> Many pre-foreclosure homes are in decent shape – sometimes they just need a little TLC (tender loving care,</span><span> for those unfamiliar with the lingo).</span><span> </span><strong>The bonus?</strong><span> You can snag them at a discount

including Harris County where Houston resides,</span><span> maintain public records of pre-foreclosure notices,</span><span> also known as Notices of Default (NOD) and Notices of Sale (NOS).</span><span> These notices include property details,</span><span> so you can sift through them to find potential diamonds in the rough.</span><span> Think of yourself as a real estate Sherlock Holmes,</span><span> minus the deerstalker hat (it gets mighty hot in Houston).</span></p><span></span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=15:1-15:72><span></span><p data-sourcepos=15:3-15:72><strong>Newspaper Spy:</strong><span> While the internet might reign supreme these days,</span><span> don't underestimate the power of good old-fashioned newspapers.</span><span> Many legal notices for pre-foreclosure homes still appear in the classifieds section,</span><span> so grab your magnifying glass (or reading glasses,</span><span> whichever works) and get to scanning.</span></p><span></span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=17:1-18:0><span></span><p data-sourcepos=17:3-17:417><strong>Buddy Up With a Real Estate Agent:</strong><span> Let's face it,</span><span> sometimes you need a good sidekick on your treasure hunt.</span><span> A real estate agent specializing in pre-foreclosure properties can be a gold mine of information (and hopefully,</span><span> they won't charge you an arm and a leg).</span><span> They can point you in the right direction,</span><span> help you navigate the process,</span><span> and maybe even hold the flashlight while you explore that dusty attic.</span></p><span></span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:58><strong>Pre-Foreclosure Pro Tips: Remember, Knowledge is

steal,</span><span> there can be reasons why the owner is behind on payments.</span><span> Get a thorough inspection to unearth any hidden problems before you mosey on down to the closing table.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=22:1-22:48><strong>Be Prepared to Move Fast:</strong><span> Pre-foreclosure deals can disappear quicker than a plate of pecan pie at a Texas Thanksgiving.</span><span> Have your financing lined up beforehand so you can act swiftly when you find the perfect place.</span></li><span></span><li data-sourcepos=23:1-24:0><strong>The Human Touch:</strong><span> Remember,</span><span> there's a real person behind the pre-foreclosure situation.</span><span> Be respectful and understanding when approaching the homeowner,</span><span> and consider seeking professional guidance if you plan to make an offer to buy.</span></li><span></span></ul><span></span><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:291><strong>So there you have it, folks!</strong><span>
