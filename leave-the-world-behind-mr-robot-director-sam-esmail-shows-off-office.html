Let’s make this different, let’s make this more interesting.'”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But it didn’t stop with office names. Each floor in Esmail Corp.’s Toluca Lake space is also devoted to a past project of his. The first floor, where he has his post-production facility, is called “Pineapple,” a reference to his Amazon series <a href=# id=auto-tag_homecoming_1 data-tag=homecoming>Homecoming</a>, his first of several collaborations with actress Julia Roberts. The second is titled “Comet,” after his first film, which starred his now-wife, Emmy Rossum. It’s where he houses his various writers rooms. And the third, the “White Rose” floor, an ode to <a href=# id=auto-tag_mr-robot_1 data-tag=mr-robot>Mr. Robot</a> — which famously transformed Esmail’s career — is where he and his fellow executives keep their offices.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Despite the degree of attention and personal curation, L.A. is not actually home base for Esmail himself. The prolific writer-director is mostly in New York these days, where he lives with Rossum and their two young children — though he regularly flies west when work demands it. Asked if L.A. has grown on him, he laughs: “I think I like it in small doses, which is why this arrangement works out quite well.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">With his latest project, apocalyptic thriller&nbsp;Leave the World Behind, debuting on <a href=# id=auto-tag_netflix_1 data-tag=netflix>Netflix</a> Dec. 8, he opened up about<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> his creative process</a>&nbsp;as well as his workspace. Below are some of the highlights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041472_v1-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Each floor of the Esmail Corp. space is also full of mementos from his previous gigs. In describing a neon red wheelbarrow, which hangs in the office kitchen, Esmail says it’s “more of a narcissistic&nbsp;reference as it’s a nod to a front for a secretive operation in Mr. Robot, only this time it’s for the Dark Army.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041730_v1-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also in the office is a painted fsociety mask, which was a wrap gift from Mr. Robot actress Carly Chaikin, who played Darlene, a member of the fsociety group.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041755-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Outside the building is signage for The American Literary Historical Society, “a reference to one of my favorite movies of all time, Three Days of the Condor,” says Esmail. “I loved how it was used as a front for a secretive CIA operation, marrying my two passions together: literature and top secret spy shit.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041746-EMBED-new-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Mixed in with family photos is a LACMA ticket stub, which dates back to Esmail’s first date with Rossum, whom he met on his 2014 directorial debut, Comet. “It has lived on my desk ever since I had an office,” he reveals of the now-faded stub.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041529_v1-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Like most writers, his personal space is also littered with scripts, including this one, for his new film, Leave the World Behind. Not all of them were written by Esmail, who’s invested in giving other, greener scribes an opportunity. “My experience with Mr. Robot was very eye-opening. I’d never even stepped foot on a TV set, and all of a sudden, I was a showrunner,” he tells THR. “I really was humbled that USA let that happen and trusted me, and I knew that when I got into this position and started the company, I wanted to do the same for other people.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/P0041659_v2-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXZuyosDUq5ysZ5yarrexjK2fnmWnpL%2BtsIybnKGhnpl6rr6Mq6abp6Risaq%2BxJyrqKpdqK6uecSspJqhnGK5onnOn52im5VifnN%2FlG9wcmpgaXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
