The Sixers faced off against the Jimmy Butler-led Miami Heat in a close game. Philly won the game in dramatic fashion, overcoming a 13-point deficit and ultimately winning 105-104. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Embiid and the Sixers</a> will face the no. 2 seed New York Knocks, led by Jalen Brunson, in the first round of the NBA playoffs.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Embiid and the Sixers struggled early in what was an ugly game of basketball. The Heat dug in defensively and deployed a zone defense that caused headaches for Embiid and his teammates. Nevertheless, the Sixers figured out Miami's scheme. They erased the deficit and closed out the game with a surprising offensive explosion from Nic Batum. The Knicks are a similarly gritty team with a lot more offensive power. With Embiid still trying to shake off the rust after a prolonged <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">absence due to injury,</a> it's going to be a tough series.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-joel-embiid-found-nic-batum-to-close-out-the-heat>Joel Embiid Found Nic Batum To Close Out The Heat</h2></span><p>PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - APRIL 17: Joel Embiid #21 of the Philadelphia 76ers is guarded by Bam Adebayo #13 of the Miami Heat during the third quarter during the Eastern Conference Play-In Tournament at the Wells Fargo Center on April 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

All the attention Joel Embiid receives when he has the ball leaves his teammate with some good looks; once he starts to find Batum, the game changes, and Philly is able to fend off a gritty Miami Heat team. Batum went 5-7 from three, and the Sixers wouldn't have won the game without his offensive explosion. Jimmy Butler was hampered by an injury he sustained in the first half. Although he played through it, he wasn't as effective down the stretch. The Heat will play the Bulls tomorrow to decide the 8th seed in the East.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The Sixers will try to get Joel Embiid<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> back to peak performance.</a> He's the most dominant player in the East when he is at his best. The Knicks will zero in on Embiid much like the Heat did, leaving the rest of the Sixers to step up. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tyrese</a> Maxey will have to perform like the all-star he is, and the rest of the supporting cast need to fill in the gaps. It will be a much closer series than the seeding suggests. The Sixers face off against the Knicks on Saturday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdnbYZ5fZdmoaidnGKyrq7IoptmmZ6ZerW0xGaqorCVp8BursSaq2aimaK6unnBrqulnaJirq%2BwjK2fnmWYmq61edOoZKydk6q%2FpnnPpZiyp5aberS8zq1kp5qRYrumw9I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
