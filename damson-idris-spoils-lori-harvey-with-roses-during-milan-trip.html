That certainly seems to be the case for Damson Idris and Lori Harvey, who have spent a significant amount of time apart this month due to their respective commitments. Being apart from your partner is hard, but luckily, the lovers were able to cross a major relationship milestone together recently – their <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">red carpet debut</a>. At the premiere of the actor's Snowfall series' sixth season, he was joined by the model, who looked as radiant as ever.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Social media users couldn't dispute the hair's obvious good looks. What they did argue, however, was the chemistry between the pair, which some say is seemingly non-existence. In response to the hate comments, Harvey <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">clapped back on Instagram</a>. She said that her distant body language was to protect her man's expensive suit from the makeup on her skin, and over the weekend, she proved how thoughtful of a boyfriend he can be.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10">Damson Tears Up Trinidad's Carnival</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For his part, Idris took a trip to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago this February to celebrate the nation's famous Carnival. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> was <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">also in attendance</a> for this year's events and even gave her first performance in such time, much to patron's pleasure. The English star clearly enjoyed his vacation and partying, as he chiefly declared on Instagram that he wants to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">buy a home there ASAP</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I need a Trini real talk, 'bout to buy a crib here," he told his followers. "Even the air taste good," Idris noted, after markedly praising Trinidad's delicious food and drinks. His only problems, it seems, are the mosquitos who "treat [him] like Popeyes," and the lack of his girlfriend's presence.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lori-takes-milan-fashion-week>Lori Takes Milan Fashion Week</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On the other side of the world, Harvey spent this past weekend in Milan, Italy. Like many others, she was invited to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">show support</a> at a designer runway. Creative Director Rhuigi Villaseñor requested the Memphis native's presence at his presentation, where she sat in the front row alongside a slew of celebrities. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>DDG</a> was present (following his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">appearance at Gucci's F/W '23 collection</a> with Halle Bailey), as was TikTok sensation Dixie D'Amelio.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While he couldn't join her on the trip, Idris made sure to keep his girl smiling with a romantic delivery during her travels. On her IG Story, Harvey posted a huge collection of red roses, as well as a note reading, "I love and miss you." In barely visible text near the bottom, she wrote, "My man, my man, my mannn," tagging her beau to show him some love.
