Read on for everything we know about a possible Selling the OC season 4.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q5L729sVVTQxrNQouZUfed-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=has-39-selling-the-oc-39-been-renewed-for-season-4-3>Has 'Selling the OC' been renewed for season 4?</h2><p>The future of Selling the OC is currently unclear. Netflix had previously renewed the series for both seasons 2 and 3, so it's now time for the streaming giant to decide whether to re-up for another two-season order (or maybe even one, but that's uncharacteristic for the Selling shows.) Per Netflix, season 3 has tallied <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/tv data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>over 10 million hours viewed in its first week out</a>, so chances seem good for a season 4 renewal.</p><h2 id=when-would-39-selling-the-oc-39-season-4-come-out-3>When would 'Selling the OC' season 4 come out?</h2><p>The Selling universe, or at least the Selling shows that have been renewed for multiple seasons (miss you, Selling Tampa), have followed a quick production schedule. Typically, new seasons are greenlit two at a time and then filmed back-to-back, later releasing within just months of each other. For example, Selling the OC was renewed for seasons 2 and 3 in January 2023 and was filmed nearly back-to-back months later, with season 2 premiering in September 2023 and season 3 in May 2024.</p><p>If a renewal announcement for Selling the OC seasons 4 and 5 comes out by fall, we could see new episodes around the same time next year or by early summer 2025.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFBm2PqpGY5Q3XZd58o2xY-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=who-would-be-in-the-cast-of-39-selling-the-oc-39-season-4-3>Who would be in the cast of 'Selling the OC' season 4?</h2><p>While most of the Selling the OC cast would likely return for a new season, there have been major shakeups at The O Group since season 3 completed filming last summer. Firstly, the office is now down one Alexandra, with Alexandra Jarvis deciding to leave the brokerage.</p><p>In an interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/alexandra-jarvis-says-the-oppenheim-group-s-toxic-culture-caused-her-to-leave-exclusive-8640174 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a>, Jarvis opened up about her departure from The O Group "several months ago."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>"There were a lot of factors that went into my decision," she said, before mentioning the "toxic culture" exhibited by some of her castmates.</p><p>“I don't really think anyone's surprised by [my departure],” Jarvis added. “I don't really know what to say about it other than I just know when it's time to leave a party.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JxvHXJmRKYXJK9K5QTfRn3-1920-80.jpg><p>Meanwhile, in perhaps less of a surprise after his tumultuous season, Sean Palmieri announced his departure from The O Group in November 2023. In a statement to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/selling-the-ocs-sean-palmieri-exits-the-oppenheim-group-exclusive-215132 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Weekly,</a> the realtor said that leaving the brokerage was purely a "business move," which he was "really excited" to make.</p><p>"Unfortunately, The Oppenheim Group was not a culture fit for me," Palmieri shared, also revealing to the outlet that he would now work out of San Diego County.</p><p>Rounding out the departures is Tyler Stanaland, who announced in October 2023 that he was leaving to work alongside his father and brother, after considering a switch during season 3. Tyler had worked with his father for 12 years before moving to The O Group in November 2021.</p><p>“Leaving the Oppenheim Group wasn’t an easy decision, but is the right decision for me and my clients,” he told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/selling-the-oc-star-tyler-stanaland-is-leaving-the-oppenheim-group-for-douglas-elliman-exclusive-8347748 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a> in an email statement.</p><p>He explained that since Selling the OC revolves around the agents at the Oppenheim Group, he would no longer appear on the series.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/akBu7235c9QdRD8A93sLKK-1920-80.jpg><p>As of season 3's release, the rest of the show's cast are still listed as agents on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.ogroup.net/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The O Group's website</a>, including Alex Hall, Alexandra Rose, Austin Victoria, Brandi Marshall, Gio Helou, Kayla Cardona, Lauren Shortt, and Polly Brindle.</p><p>Notably, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/who-is-ali-harper-from-selling-the-oc-season-2/>Ali Harper</a> is not included on the website, but that's probably because she is not a fully licensed agent yet. In an interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/selling-the-ocs-ali-harper-still-hasnt-gotten-real-estate-license/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Us Weekly</a>, the Tennessee native confirmed that she has not taken her exam yet.</p><p>“So, we are still in the process,” she told the outlet. “It’s actually taken quite a long time to get approved to take the actual exam. It’s just kind of been out of my hands.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOrJylpJmjtG7Ax55kqJtdqLKiv86nZG1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
