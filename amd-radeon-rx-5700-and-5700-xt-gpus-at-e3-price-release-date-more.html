All of the cards are scheduled to be released July 7 alongside AMD’s third-generation Ryzen CPUs.</p><p id=bYoTX3>The Radeon RX 5700 XT will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 video memory and deliver up to 9.75 teraflops of performance. The GPU comes with a standard internal clock of 1605 MHz, but will come with a seven-phase digital power system to help make it more stable for overclocking. During the Next Horizon Gaming conference on Monday, AMD showed off exactly how the card would perform head to head against the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070. In the AMD demo, the 5700 XT outperformed the RTX 2070 by almost 20 frames per second.</p><p id=Pr1Msc>Meanwhile, the RX 5700 will be a slight step down in both performance and price from the RX 5700 XT. While the RX 5700 will also feature 8 GB of GDDR6 video memory, its performance will top out at 7.95 teraflops. Once again, AMD showed its new card beating Nvidia’s RTX 2060, the card that AMD said is most comparable to the RX 5700.</p><p id=8BMKjS>The Navi family of GPUs will offer a variety of unique AMD features, but the feature that got the most attention during the conference was AMD’s new Radeon Anti-Lag technology. While AMD didn’t go into the details of the Anti-Lag tech, it was shown to give an average of 30 percent faster response time between inputs and the game’s response.</p><p id=zsRs3i>AMD also closed the show with a special surprise introduction of its top of the line card in the 5700 line, called the Radeon RX 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition. Like the other 5700 cards it will feature 8 GB of GDDR6 video memory, but its performance will top out at over 10 teraflops. The 50 Anniversary Edition card will also feature a base clock speed of 1680 MHz and a boost clock speed of up to 1980 MHz.</p><p id=GHBSiZ>It’s worth noting that AMD did not make any mention of hardware support for <a href=#>real-time ray tracing</a> in the RX 5700 XT or RX 5700. That’s a next-generation graphics feature that is the main selling point of the <a href=#>two Nvidia GPUs</a> that AMD cited as the competition for its new Navi graphics cards.</p><p id=YnvhFN><strong>Update (July 5):</strong> On Friday afternoon, two days before the launch of the RX 5700 series, <a href=#>AMD announced that it is lowering the prices of all three cards in the lineup</a>. The 50th Anniversary Edition AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT will now be priced at $449, the AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT at $399, and the AMD Radeon RX 5700 at $349.</p><p id=TAZYjM>It’s worth noting that these changes come just a few days after Nvidia revealed its new <a href=# rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" has-subtag=true data-cdata='{"rewritten_url":"https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_18424512__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-20-series-super-gpus/\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/10/18660471/amd-rx-5700-xt-release-date-price-specs-e3","subtag_max_length":50,"subtag_delim_length":3,"subtag_key":"xcust","subtag_data":{"xcust":"___pl__p_18424512__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder","id":"66960X1516586","xs":"1","url":"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-20-series-super-gpus/","referrer":"polygon.com","sref":"https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/10/18660471/amd-rx-5700-xt-release-date-price-specs-e3"},"encode_subtag":false}'>Super line of graphics cards</a>, which are updates of some of the company’s first-generation RTX GPUs. Nvidia priced the Super cards to compete with AMD’s original pricing for the RX 5700 line, and will release them on July 9, two days after the RX 5700 series’ debut. With AMD’s price drop, however, the the Radeon cards will remain cheaper than their GeForce competition, just as they were originally announced. Here’s a recap of the new pricing:</p><p id=WVccBS><strong>$349:</strong> AMD RX 5700 / Nvidia RTX 2060<br><strong>$399:</strong> AMD RX 5700 XT / Nvidia RTX 2060 Super<br><strong>$449:</strong> AMD RX 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition<br><strong>$499:</strong> Nvidia RTX 2070 Super [replacing RTX 2070 at same price point]<br><strong>$699:</strong> Nvidia RTX 2080 Super [replacing RTX 2080 at same price point, on July 23]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbvLsp6opl6YvK57xGxma2hhbnx3e5BpZmpwZmt9dYOQaJimnF2nxW6BlmlnZrCkYr%2BmuMSaqp5llJbBpnnPq6CcnV2ovaav0macbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
