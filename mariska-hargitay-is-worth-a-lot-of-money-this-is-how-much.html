She has the longest tenure of any actor on any of the Law and Order shows, having appeared consistently since the show began in 1999, so it's no wonder she makes around a half-million dollars per episode. Hargitay makes sure to share her immense wealth that she's earned from the show, though, including contributing to the nonprofit she founded called <a href=#>Joyful Heart Foundation</a>.</p><p>The foundation was created in 2004 as a response to Hargitay's work on Law and Order: SVU. Because her character deals with so many cases of sexual assault and abuse, the star wanted to find a way to help real people dealing with those same problems, so she created the foundation. On its website, the foundation's mission is to "transform society's response to sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse, support survivors' healing, and end this violence forever."</p><p>According to the foundation, Hargitay "received hundreds, then thousands of letters and emails from survivors disclosing their stories of abuse, many for the first time. She wanted to answer — really answer — those letters, to address the suffering they described, and honor acts of courage they represented." Thus, the foundation was born.&nbsp;So while Hargitay brings in the big bucks on TV, she also takes the time to pay it forward off-screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2thaH9ze8yaqaKrm5Z6qa3RoKCtmalitrR51qipraBdlnqtu9Nmpp9lnaS7psWMrZ%2Biq12ewG60zrBkpq2TnXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
