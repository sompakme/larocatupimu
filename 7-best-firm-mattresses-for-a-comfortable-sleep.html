It also takes pressure off the lower back, which can be a massive problem for many people,” she explained to news.com.au.</p><p>“Firmer mattresses tend to be more comfortable for back and front sleepers, whereas side sleepers might prefer a softer mattress.”</p><p>But how hard is <i>too</i> hard? Samantha suggests picturing yourself spending long periods of time in your favourite position to get an idea of whether a mattress will be comfortable enough.</p><p>“Does it feel comfortable? Lots of mattresses will naturally get softer with time (depending on the quality) so worth bearing this in mind. Also, if you share your bed, it’s worth trying to compromise on the firmness with your partner!” she said.</p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c576fa02eb03fa17f0851fd4a55ee146 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Top mattresses for all types of sleepers</a></b></p><p><b>RELATED: <a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=be7df0cf6f9e49e485431f0fe164ec93 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best bed-in-a-box mattresses to buy in 2023</a></b></p><p>To help you get the good night’s sleep you deserve, we’ve narrowed several top-rated firm mattresses in Australia. One of our favourites is the <a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Sealy Advantage Barbuda Firm Mattress, which is currently 45 per cent off.</a></p><h2>MATTRESS FIRMNESS SCALE</h2><p>To get an idea of whether a mattress is right for you, mattresses are rated against a firmness scale to indicate how soft or hard the mattress feels. The scale is numbered from one to 10 – the higher the number, the firmer the mattress. Medium firm mattresses generally sit around 6.</p><p>But keep in mind that comfort and firmness is very subjective and varies depending on factors like body weight, so view the ratings as a general guide. People with a heavier frame typically find firmer mattresses more comfortable, while those with a lighter body type may prefer a softer feel.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the firmness scale doesn’t show how well a supportive a mattress is. Support is all about how well it relieves pressure points keeps your spine aligned, while firmness mainly refers to how the surface feels.</p><h2>HOW WE CHOOSE PRODUCTS</h2><p>Our team of experienced writers spend hours researching products to include in articles. We find out what factors make a good product by talking to experts, reviewing test results and analysing thousands of customer reviews.</p><h2>OUR TOP PICKS</h2><h2 id=U823260736859D3H>BEST FIRM MATTRESS OVERALL</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Studio Extra Firm Mattress – Memory Foam + Pocket Spring, $629.30 (down from $899) at Mattress Crafters</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>If firmness is what you’re after, you can’t go wrong with this option from <a class=body-link href=# title=mattresscrafters.com.au rel=sponsored>Mattress Crafters</a>. Featuring exceptional support and comfort, this mattress is set to deliver your best sleep yet. On top of that, the combination of the visco-elastic foam and the pocket springs helps to ensure that you’re not only comfortable but also that the mattress is breathable too. The hybrid mattress includes both memory foam and a 2.4 coil spring system providing a plush surface and additional stability.</p><p>Other notable features include 15 year warranty, 100 night trial, CertiPur-US, meaning no harmful chemicals were used, and it’s OEKO-TEX certified, meaning it is eco-friendly.</p><p>One five-star review wrote, “We are so happy we made the choice to buy this mattress. Very firm as we excepted. Excellent quality. Super fast delivery. Five star for everything!”</p><p>Another said, “This the best mattress we’ve had so far. We needed mattress that would not dip and so far no signs of dipping. Very pleased!!”</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Firm Bed Mattress, $1104.15 (down from $1299) at Sleep Firm</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>Don’t want to bother with any of that plush nonsense? <a class=body-link href=# title=sleepfirm.com.au rel=sponsored>Sleep Firm</a> has you covered with its Firm Bed Mattress. It sits at a nine out of 10 on the firmness scale, according to the brand, making it a true firm mattress (unlike many other mattresses on the market, which are typically medium-firm with some extra hardness).</p><p>It’s loaded with a Boomerang Foam that has been specifically designed to suit a firm bed-in-a-box style mattress. This high density foam helps improve edge support and gives it a high rebound level to prevent sagging and ensure long-lasting (firm) support.</p><p>“(T)his mattress is seriously firm. I mean, rock-solid in the best possible way. It’s like sleeping on a sturdy cloud that actually holds you up. No more sinking deep into the mattress and feeling like you’re being swallowed up. The support it provides is out of this world!” praised a reviewer.</p><p>“But don’t let the firmness fool you. This mattress still manages to be super cozy.</p><p>“Even after using it for a while, it hasn’t lost its shape or support. It’s like sleeping on a brand new mattress every night. Hats off to the folks who designed this thing. They really knew what they were doing when they made it heavy sleeper-friendly.”</p><h2 id=U823260736859EkD>BEST MEDIUM-FIRM MATTRESSES</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# title=www.sleepingduck.com rel=sponsored>Sleeping Duck SD Mach II, $1649 at Sleeping Duck</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>In a battle with your partner on how firm your mattress should be? <a class=body-link href=# title=www.sleepingduck.com rel=sponsored>Sleeping Duck’s SD Mach II mattress</a> comes in a Half-Half option, which has a firm side and a medium-firm side to satisfy everyone.</p><p>The mattress features an AntiGravity surface foam for that feeling off “weightlessness”, and a multi-zoned system with twice tempered steel springs and several support zones to target different parts of the body.</p><p>“I needed a firmer mattress than hubby and had trouble finding one that suited us both. As I sleep on my stomach, my lower back was quite sore with our old mattress. I haven’t had these issues with the Sleeping Duck,” praised a shopper.</p><p>“This is the most supportive and comfortable mattress I have ever had,” raved another.</p><p>If a standard firm mattress is still a little too soft, Sleeping Duck offers an Extra Firm option. But rather than reordering a new mattress, you can just order custom made Precision Foam Pads and add it on top (like with any other topper). And don’t worry, it still has the brand’s AntiGravity layer for some softness.</p><p>(P.S Sleeping Duck also has a <a class=body-link href=# title=www.sleepingduck.com rel=sponsored>firmness quiz</a> on their website to help you figure out the right firmness for you.)</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress, $1499 (down from $2639) at Origin</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=originmattress.com.au rel=sponsored>The Origin Hybrid Pro Mattress</a> is another option worth checking out for those who prefer a firmer feel but don’t want to commit to a true firm mattress.</p><p>With the help of Origin’s team of orthopaedics, this CertiPUR-US certified mattress is designed to offer more support in the centre third of the mattress (i.e. where most of your body weight sits) and cradle your pressure points to give your back and joints some relief. The pillowtop is also made with Tencel, ensuring your head stays cool and comfortable.</p><p>“Amazing mattress! Really cooling and comfortable. Husband and I were impressed by just how fast the mattress opens up,” a happy shopper posted online.</p><p>“Wonderful experience and mattress. Surprised by just how good the quality is … Would (definitely) recommend,” another wrote.</p><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>The Koala Mattress, $1200 at Koala</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>Another hugely popular option is <a class=body-link href=# title=koala.com rel=sponsored>The Koala Mattress</a>. It features three-zoned support to provide pressure relief for your shoulders, hips and feet, plus a flippable mattress topper that lets you switch firmness levels by simply flipping it over.

Hands down the best mattress I’ve ever owned,” a happy shopper posted, rating the mattress five stars.</p><p>“It was so easy to set up. My nights have been more restful than ever and it felt even better to sleep in after a few days! The delivery process was quick and seamless. Highly recommend.”</p><p>“This mattress is definitely a great investment. It may appear more expensive than other products in the market but the quality is what you really pay for,” another wrote.</p><h2 id=U823260736859e3E>BEST PREMIUM FIRM MATTRESS</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>Sealy Advantage Barbuda Firm Mattress, $714.45 (down from $1299) at Myer</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>If you want to invest in a mid to high end firm mattress, it’s hard to look past this household name. The <a class=body-link href=# title=myer.sjv.io rel=sponsored>Sealy mattress</a> features the brand’s CoreSupport System coil, which has been tempered twice for durability and long lasting support and stability. It also has an EdgeGuard to maximise your sleeping space and leave you with a stable seating edge that won’t make you feel like you’ll fall off the bed.</p><p>Many online reviewers agree the “high quality” of the Sealy mattress is noticeable, and the price is definitely reasonable compared to other premium options on the market.</p><p>Keep in mind it’s on the softer side for a firm mattress. If you’re after a super firm feel, see if you can test out the mattress in store.</p><p>“Very comfortable and the right level of firmness! A bargain price with efficient delivery!” a happy shopper posted.</p><p>Another said it “felt like a dream”.</p><h2 id=U823260736859mAI>BEST FIRM MATTRESS FOR HOT SLEEPERS</h2><p><b><a class=body-link href=# rel=sponsored>The Lite Mattress, $649 (down from $1049) at Noa Home</a></b></p><p><b>What You Need To Know</b></p><p>Tend to sweat or get overly warm during the night? Take a look at the <a class=body-link href=# title=www.noahome.com rel=sponsored>Noa Lite Mattress</a>. It features a gel infused cooling memory foam to wick away moisture, along with a hand-tuffed Tencel cover for breathability. The mattress is also made with both springs and foam to promote more airflow compared to regular mattresses (which typically retain more heat).</p><p>“We were very sceptical about the mattresses in a box. Our son purchased one first and he said it was great, so we got one it was the best decision we made. You feel like you are sleeping on a cloud,” a reviewer posted.</p><p>“Wow, this Lite mattress is clearly designed with a breathable cover or something promoting air circulation and preventing overheating. It’s the perfect mattress and an excellent choice for anyone looking for a comfortable, supportive, and affordable item,” another wrote.</p><h2>CAN A MATTRESS BE TOO FIRM?</h2><p>Yes – Samantha says it’s important to find a balance between firm and comfortable, rather than hunting down a mattress that seems to have the hardest surface. She recommends firmer mattresses for back and tummy sleepers, while side sleepers should opt for a softer feel.</p><p><b>More mattress coverage</b></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c576fa02eb03fa17f0851fd4a55ee146 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best mattresses</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=be7df0cf6f9e49e485431f0fe164ec93 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best mattresses in a box</a></p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=cb1c2993e90ba2ee0ffd4b9a891aed4e data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best memory foam mattresses</a></p><p><a class=body-link href=# title=www.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=c51bfda800ede198ddbe0e66bd8f2dd8 data-tgev-label=best-of data-tgev-metric=ev>Best mattresses for back pain</a></p><p>You can also sign up to our <a class=body-link href=# title=www.newsletters.news.com.au data-tgev=event119 data-tgev-container=bodylink data-tgev-order=newscomau data-tgev-label=newscomau data-tgev-metric=ev>free news.com.au checkout newsletter</a> to stay updated on the latest trends and deals.
