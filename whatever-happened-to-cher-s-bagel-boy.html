He had a role in the 1989 Tom Cruise movie "Born On the Fourth of July," and in 1991's "Soapdish." His acting career didn't really take off, despite remaining friends with Cher after their split in 1989.</p><p dir=ltr>Camilletti got out of both the bagel-making business and the acting business, per <a href=#>InStyle</a>. He got his pilot's license and makes a good living as a pilot flying celebrities around the world in private jets. He's even given his ex-girlfriend a lift to Jamaica, per <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>. Cher also told Vanity Fair, "Old boyfriends make good friends. Robert comes to Christmas dinner. He is a huge pilot. He flies for all the biggest names in this town."</p><p dir=ltr>Cher has nothing but good things to say about Camilletti. She said Camilletti made her feel "young and wanted." She reminisced about those days in the late 1980s when she and Camilletti were dating with Woman's Realm (via <a href=#>The Daily Mail</a>). "It's no use denying I miss those days. He was possibly the one true love of my life. I hate the phrase 'toy boy'. It's so demeaning," she said in reference to their 18-year age difference. She went on to say, "Rob excited me more than anyone else before."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWtjan93e9ahmK2dppq%2FbrTAqaeeppWZerW7jJyfnqqjYq%2Bis8SlZJunqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
