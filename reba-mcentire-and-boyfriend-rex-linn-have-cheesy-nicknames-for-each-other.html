He inadvertently made them Instagram official by <a href=#>posting a pic</a> of the two of them with the caption, "Had a fantastic dinner with this Oklahoma girl. Tater Tots and Ketchup included." McEntire later revealed that it was then when Linn gave her the nickname "Tater Tot." During a visit to the <a href=#>"Jennifer Hudson Show,"</a> the actor-singer shared that she and Linn had gone to a wine bar after dinner and the woman working there told them, "Well, I understand you've already had dinner, but we do have some good appetizers." She suggested tater tots and McEntire enthusiastically raised her hand, to which Linn declared, "That's your nickname from here on out â€” Tater Tot." She then revealed that her nickname for her boyfriend is "Sugar Tot."</p><p dir=ltr>McEntire opened up about her new relationship in an October 2020 episode of her podcast, <a href=#>"Living & Learning with Reba McEntire."</a> She shared how dating for her was "fun and exciting" and added, "It's good to have a person to talk to, laugh with, get into subjects about what's going on. Discussions about our past, our family, funny stories, him being an actor, me being an actress. And he's very into my music. I'm very into his career." The two have made no secret of their love for each other and "The Tots" continue to support each other with their respective careers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampobX5yf46rnJuZXaKwprrToqmeZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWimsVuuMinpWammZi4r63MnmSfp6JisqKvx2amraCVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
