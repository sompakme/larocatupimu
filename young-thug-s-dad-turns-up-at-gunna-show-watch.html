The rapper took a plea deal at the end of 2022 after getting arrested on RICO charges along with 27 other alleged YSL members, including Young Thug. He was released shortly after and immediately hit with speculation that he had turned his back on his co-defendants. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">He denies this</a>, but regardless, the debacle has left a lasting mark on his reputation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During an interview with Infamous Sylvia in September of last year, Williams Sr. came to Gunna's defense. He insisted that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he hadn't done anything that would harm his son's case</a>. "I love Gunna," he admitted at the time, though it did little to quell the controversy. Now, however, he's stepped out yet again to show his love for the rapper.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jeffery-williams-sr-lives-his-best-life-at-gunna-show>Jeffery Williams Sr. Lives His Best Life At Gunna Show</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This time, it was through an appearance at one of his recent performances in Atlanta. In a new clip making its rounds online, Williams Sr. is seen turning up to Gunna's 2021 collaborative track with his son, "Ski." He <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">didn't hold back</a> either, putting his dance moves on full display as the rest of the crowd egged him on. Clearly, despite what haters have to say about it, Young Thug's dad is still rocking with Gunna.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This appears to support the claims Gunna made during an interview with XXL earlier this year. When asked about his relationship with Young Thug and whether or not it's changed, he insisted that they're on the same terms they've always been on. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">“It's the same.&nbsp;It's love, always,"</a> he told the outlet.
