A clip has been circulating showing a man that resembles <a href=# rel>the Chicago-born performer</a>, and apparently, they won't stop reminding him of it. He seems to be experiencing some online trolling because of clip, and it looks like he's had enough. G Herbo took to social media to share the clip, telling social media users to quit sending it to him. "Next person send me this [I'm] blocking you," he wrote alongside a series of laughing emojis.</p><p>Strangely enough, this isn't the first time G Herbo's had an unfortunate experience with one of his lookalikes. Back in 2017, photos of a man who resembles the artist performing oral sex on another man surfaced online, sparking a slew of homophobic posts aimed at the rapper. He quickly hopped on social media <a href=# rel>to clear up the speculation</a>, however, noting that he wasn't actually in the photos.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Ari Fletcher Ropes Her Son With G Herbo, Yosohn, Into Taina Williams Drama</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-g-herbo-has-had-enough>G Herbo Has Had Enough</h2></span><p>In 2020, G Herbo even met up with one of his lookalikes, posing for photos alongside the man and giving his social media a major boost. “<a href=# rel>MY POPS GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO DO,</a>" the artist jokingly wrote.
