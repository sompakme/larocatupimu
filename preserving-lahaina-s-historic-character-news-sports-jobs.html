One of Maui’s most sacred sites is Mokuʻula, an island on the south end of Lahaina that is surrounded by a freshwater pond known as Loko o Mokuhinia.</p><p>Mokuʻula and Loko o Mokuhinia were regarded as royalty, serving as a home to the moʻo wahine Kihawahine and Maui mōʻī–including Piʻilani and Kauikeaouli. This historic area and its meaning and significance radiate out from Mokuʻula and Loko o Mokuhinia–not to the exclusion of other cultures and areas, but as a foundation for a sense of place.</p><p>Loko iʻa, alawai, ʻauwai and loʻi were part of the wetland ecosystem that thrived in Lahaina. The mauka water that fed these wetland areas were later diverted by Western entities to serve the sugarcane industry.</p><p>Today, we see the effects of the geological, ecological and political changes that were imposed on kānaka Hawaiʻi in the past. Through public testimony, community members have expressed their frustrations and the need to see improvements to the health, safety and culture of Lahaina.</p><p>Out of the three historic districts established by the County of Maui, two are located in West Maui.</p><p>Historic district 1, created within Lahaina, covers various streets and structures such as Hale Paʻahao, Hale Aloha Church, Maria Lanakila Church and more. Through the historic district ordinance, county officials are directed to conduct community outreach and make plans for restoration of these historic structures and sites.</p><p>Historic district 2, also created within Lahaina, include areas of Front Street and Malu ʻUlu o Lele Park, Honpa Hongwanji Mission, Lahainaluna Road and more. This district was created <span class=quotations>“to preserve the charm of Lahaina by preserving the architectural styles which are unique to Lahaina.”</span></p><p>Through the historic district assessment, the county is responsible for ensuring that significant historic buildings are protected and new construction is architecturally compatible. Building materials should account for durability through future disasters, and the design of new structures should consider surrounding buildings.</p><p>Lahaina’s true potential is shown in its history. Through trial and error, kānaka Hawaiʻi have already learned what works best for the geography and ecology of various places throughout Hawaiʻi, including Lahaina.</p><p>Now is the time to work together to assemble new standards and plans for what we’d like to see. We are faced with critical need to restore what was lost in a way that will sustain us and our keiki for centuries to come.</p><p>I’m grateful for my role in the process both as chair of the Disaster, Resilience, International Affairs and Planning Committee and as the councilmember from the West Maui residency area. But of course, making good decisions for Maui County requires active engagement from constituents.</p><p>We rely on residents’ knowledge and passion. Please share with me and my colleagues on the council your ideas on the best ways to rebuild our community while preserving Lahaina’s historic character.</p><p>* Tamara Paltin is the chair of the Disaster, Resilience, International Affairs and Planning Committee.
