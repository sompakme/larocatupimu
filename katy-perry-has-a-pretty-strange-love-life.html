It's unclear if they were on the same page about that. An insider&nbsp;told <a href=#>Radar Online</a>&nbsp;that "Orlando never changed his ways with hanging out with other women [during the relationship]. He would still continue to hang out with his actor buddies and there were always a ton of sexy women around."</p><p>Bloom was even photographed in some compromising positions with other ladies before he and Perry announced their breakup. In May 2016, <a href=#>TMZ</a> snapped Bloom hugging and allegedly kissing much-younger pop star Selena Gomez in Las Vegas, though witnesses later insisted that Gomez went back to her hotel room alone. On March 1, 2017, the<a href=#>&nbsp;Daily Mail</a> published photos of Bloom cozying up to Erin McCabe, a daughter of Global Green President Les McCabe. Bloom reportedly rubbed Erin's backs and even swapped place cards with other guests at a gala to sit together. Six days later, he and Perry released a joint statement announcing they were dunzo ... at least for a while.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb25hZoNwv9OrmKeflWLBqbXNoKpmo5Gpxm68xKupsqtdma61tc2gZKGho6m8s8WO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
