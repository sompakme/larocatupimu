While this specific case isn't too wild, it did make for a pretty bizarre and almost comical moment, if it wasn't for the circumstances. Moreover, it centers around a recent clip that surfaced online of someone greeting him at a bottle signing event in Las Vegas. After the rapper signed a bottle for the person recording, it turns out that they were actually a prompter. They gave him paperwork for a lawsuit against him and walked away, and Ari Fletcher's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">husband</a> had an incredulous look on his face.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, he probably did not expect to receive paperwork on this occasion, especially from someone who went to get a signed bottle. Regardless, these papers allegedly focus on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the Loaf Boyz executive</a>'s supposed failure to repay a no-show back in 2021. Since we don't have any further details about the lawsuit, we can assume that the plaintiff wanted to resolve this in a more private manner with Moneybagg Yo. Otherwise, we would've already heard about it from another source, rather than this shy prompter who ironically created the more interesting story.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-moneybagg-yo-hit-with-papers-in-the-middle-of-bottle-signing-watch>Moneybagg Yo Hit With Papers In The Middle Of Bottle Signing: Watch</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately for the Memphis MC, it looks like this no-show is a bit of a common trend in his career. Well, not the no-show specifically, but rather a general streak of bad luck when it comes to not being able to perform. For example, back in September, organizers <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">suddenly canceled his hometown concert</a> at the FedEx Forum arena, which Moneybagg Yo was not happy with at all. He expressed disappointment in not being able to put on for his city.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I did not cancel s**t FedExForum canceled the show!” Bagg shared on Facebook. “I Spent 300k in production and had <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">MAJOR special guests</a> popping out to help me put on for my city! S**t broke my heart frfr that was the one show I was looking for to I love coming home [broken heart emoji]. I tried everything in my power to assure them that none was gone happen! Unfortunately At the moment we looking for another venue that’s large enough will keep u updated thanks for everybody support [100 emoji]."
