His consistency has made him a huge hit with his fanbase, and as you can imagine, he was back with more this week as he dropped a brand new banger called "HANDSOMER." Typically, Russ goes the love song route on new music Friday, but this time around, he decided to go for something new as he came through with a song in which he is unabashedly braggadocios.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Throughout the song, Russ talks about his money, his style, and his ability to get women. Russ believes his material wealth makes him "handsomer" than he already is, which makes for a nice use of a word that doesn't actually exist. The beat to the song is quite catchy, and Russ' flows are solid, as always.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You can check out the song, down below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span><strong>Quotable Lyrics:</strong></span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Balenciaga slides so she sly<br>She said it's cause the vibe, mmmm, she lyin'<br>We both know that I'm a walkin lick<br>Why you think she all up on my dick?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
