Damon and Affleck, childhood friends from Cambridge, Massachusetts, were struggling young actors in Los Angeles when they began working on the screenplay, which, after several years and hundreds of pages of rewrites, they sold to Castle Rock in 1994 for $675,000. Castle Rock, though, eventually put the script in turnaround, giving the two just 30 days to find a new home for it. Enter Kevin Smith, who first cast Affleck in 1995’s Mall Rats and was writing a lead role for him in his 1997 romantic comedy Chasing Amy. Smith took the screenplay to Miramax’s Harvey Weinstein, who agreed to buy it from Castle Rock and let Damon and Affleck play the leads.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Smith “is the reason Good Will Hunting got made. We were dead in the water, all the offers had evaporated,” Damon would later tell Entertainment Weekly. Once Gus Van Sant came on board as director, the film shot in Cambridge, Boston and Toronto in the spring of 1997 and arrived in theaters that December.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the 70th Academy Awards the following March, Affleck, then 25, became the youngest winner of the original screenplay prize — by then, Damon was 27. As both hoisted their Oscars aloft, Affleck began his acceptance by cracking, “I just said to Matt losing would suck, and winning would be really scary and it’s really, really scary.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This story first appeared in The Hollywood Reporter’s Nov. 1 daily issue at the American Film Market.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKi7zp1ksKGcoXqpwc2toKefXaKus7fErWSpqpVivLSvwKuqZmliaIJzgZFsbG9n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
