The first of Dylan's most important loves was Suze Rotolo, an artist who was the daughter of Communists, credited with giving the young Dylan political insights that would come to inform some his most famous songs of the period, according to the Irish <a href=#>Independent</a>.&nbsp;Rotolo was immortalised in 1963 when she appeared arm-in-arm with the songwriter on the cover of his second album, The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan. It was reportedly Rotolo for whom Dylan wrote many of his early love songs, including the classic "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right."</p><p>Dylan later wrote about Rotolo in his <a href=#>autobiography</a>: "She was the most erotic thing I'd ever seen ... The air was suddenly filled with banana leaves. We started talking and my head started to spin."</p><p>The relationship apparently turned sour when Dylan become involved with a woman who was to become his next major love: singer, songwriter, and activist Joan Baez. The pair bonded over a shared love of folk music in 1963, according to <a href=#>Biography</a>.&nbsp;This relationship didn't last, either. The pair broke up in 1965 during Dylan's tour of the UK, with many details of the deterioration of their partnership captured in the 1967 documentary <a href=#>Dont Look Back</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bl2poampflnqtu86kZJqsXZe8o3nDsqOapqNisLC5z6WgnJmkmrFuuM6vnGakmZuycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
