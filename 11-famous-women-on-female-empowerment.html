"We want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for gender equality." She has remained steadfast in her fight for gender equality, famously saying in 2015: "If you stand for equality, then you're a feminist." In 2016, she spoke at the UN General Assembly, tackling sexual violence in universities: "The [university] experience must make it clear that the safety of women, minorities, and anyone who may be vulnerable, is a right, not a privilege. A right that will be respected by a community that believes and supports survivors and that recognizes that when one person's safety is violated, everyone feels their own safety is violated."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beyonc></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beyoncé</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>C Flanigan/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before she displayed the word "FEMINIST" in big bold letters during her Mrs. Carter tour, Bey penned an essay on why gender equality is a myth: "We need to stop buying into the myth about gender equality. It isn't a reality yet," she wrote. "We have to teach our boys the rules of equality and respect, so that as they grow up, gender equality becomes a natural way of life ... We have a lot of work to do, but we can get there if we work together. Women are more than 50 percent of the population and more than 50 percent of voters. We must demand that we all receive 100 percent of the opportunities."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-jennifer-lawrence></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015, Lawrence wrote an essay for Lena Dunham's Lenny Letter, entitled, "Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?" A Sony email hack in 2014 revealed that while she and her female co-star in American Hustle, Amy Adams, received seven percent of backend profits for the movie, their male co-stars (Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper and Jeremy Renner) all made nine percent. "I didn't get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn't want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don't need," she said. "But if I'm honest with myself, I would be lying if I didn't say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn't want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,'" Lawrence wrote. "At the time, that seemed like a fine idea, until I saw the payroll on the Internet and realized every man I was working with definitely didn't worry about being 'difficult' or 'spoiled.'"</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tina-fey></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tina Fey</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David Crotty/Patrick McMullan</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Bitches get stuff done," Fey once said on Saturday Night Live, proving that brevity is also the soul of being a boss.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-amy-schumer></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Amy Schumer</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>George Pimentel/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I am a woman with thoughts and questions and shit to say," Schumer said at the Gloria Awards and Gala, hosted by the Ms. Foundation for Women in 2014. "I say if I'm beautiful. I say if I'm strong. You will not determine my story — I will. I will speak and share and fuck and love and I will never apologize to the frightened millions who resent that they never had it in them to do it. I stand here and I am amazing, for you.

While speaking at the 2015 Hollywood Reporter Annual Women in Entertainment Breakfast, the actress said, "It's our job now … to take the next step to support each other, to support younger generations … as women on a 'power list' it is our duty and also our privilege to transfer that power onto marginalized people with stories to tell ... I am advocating for all of us here to make it our mission to use our resources to turn this around as a team to consider women, women of color, LGBTQ people, not just tell their stories but to tap them for jobs that we have historically accepted as being done by white dudes in polar fleeces.

So I lived with a very diverse group of personalities, and we formed a very tight bond as a result."
