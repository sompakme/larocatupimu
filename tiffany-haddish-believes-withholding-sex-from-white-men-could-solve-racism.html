During a virtual roundtable discussion for&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;with fellow female comedy actresses Jameela Jamil, Elle Fanning,&nbsp;Jane Levy,&nbsp;Robin Thede and Amy Sedaris, Tiffany shared her thoughts on the racial crisis in America and what it's like being a comedian during this time. The moderator asked Tiffany how she's managing to still bring humour to this massive moment of unrest, to which she said,&nbsp;“I’d just talk my truth."</p><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Like, people have asked me, ‘Tiffany, how can we solve this? What do you think we could do?'" she continued. "To be honest, I don’t know. But I know when I have problems and I want them solved, I just stop having sex and everything’s solved. So, if everybody just stopped having sex, especially if you are in an interracial relationship and your man is white, stop having sex with your white&nbsp;man. Things will change.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Tiffany's advice was not limited to Black people in interracial relationships, though; she also advised white women to do the same.&nbsp;“If you are a white woman and you’ve got a white man, stop having sex with that white man. When a white man ain’t gettin’ no sex, things change, that I know.” Jameela then pointed out that the problem might be that people aren't having&nbsp;enough&nbsp;sex, but Tiffany responded, "sex is power."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“If a Black man ain’t gettin’ no sex,” she said, “he’s going to team up with the white man. ‘Look, brother, we’ve got to figure this out. OK? The women ain’t having sex with us and I don’t want to have sex with a man. So we’ve got to figure this out. We’ve got to make it right.'”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Watch the preview for the&nbsp;THR&nbsp;comedy actresses roundtable below.
