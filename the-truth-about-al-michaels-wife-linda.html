Speaking to <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Sports Illustrated</a> in 2014, Al said that the two fell in love as teenagers. "Linda and I met in the 10th grade so we have known each other since we were 15," he recalled. "She is the love of my life."</p><p dir=ltr>While Al has been awarded many accolades in his sports broadcasting career — including&nbsp;<a href=# one-link-mark=yes>the prestigious Ford C. Frick Award in 2021</a> — he told SI that Linda is "the biggest piece of luck" he's had in his life and said that she's the only one who knows him the best. But besides falling in love at an early age, the couple also worked together when Al started out in broadcasting, learning under the guidance of famed game show host Chuck Barris.</p><p dir=ltr>Al's first job was being an office boy under Barris and helped pick the women who appeared on "The Dating Game," according to the <a href=# one-link-mark=yes>Los Angeles Times</a>. Meanwhile, Linda worked as the assistant prize coordinator on "The Newlywed Game" — another Barris creation — which was fitting as the two had just gotten married in 1966. However, working together is just one of their preferred ways of spending time with each other.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcG5jZYB5e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2WuW65yJyfmp2cqHq4tcWeZKWhnpmucA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
