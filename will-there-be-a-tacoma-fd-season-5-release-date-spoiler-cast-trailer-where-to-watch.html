Release Date, Spoiler, Cast, Trailer &amp;amp; Where to Watch</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong><a href=#>Tacoma FD Season 5</a></strong>: Tacoma FD is a hilarious sitcom that follows the antics of a group of firefighters in one of the wettest cities in America. The show, created by and starring Kevin Heffernan and Steve Lemme of Super Troopers fame, has been a hit on truTV since its debut in 2019. The fourth season of Tacoma FD wrapped up in October 2023, leaving fans wondering if there will be a fifth season of the comedy series. Here is everything we know so far about Tacoma FD Season 5.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Renewal_Status></span>Renewal Status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of November 03, 2023, truTV has not officially renewed Tacoma FD for a fifth season. However, this does not mean that the show is canceled or that there is no hope for its return. In fact, truTV has been very supportive of Tacoma FD and its creators, renewing the show for a fourth season in November 2021, before the third season even premiered1</p><p>Additionally, Tacoma FD has been performing well in terms of ratings and viewership, ranking as one of the top five cable comedies in 2021 among adults aged 18-49. The show also has a loyal fan base and a positive critical reception, with an average rating of 8.1/10 on IMDb and 93% on Rotten Tomatoes3<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">4</a></p><p>Therefore, it is likely that truTV will renew Tacoma FD for a fifth season, especially considering that the show has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing strikes in the entertainment industry, which have delayed production and reduced episode counts. The creators and cast of Tacoma FD have also expressed their enthusiasm and optimism for continuing the show, as well as their gratitude to the fans and the network.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tacoma_FD_Season_5_Release_Date_Prediction></span>Tacoma FD Season 5 Release Date Prediction<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Assuming that truTV renews Tacoma FD for a fifth season soon, we can expect the show to return sometime in <strong>late 2024</strong>. The previous seasons of Tacoma FD have followed a consistent pattern of premiering in March or July and ending in May or October, with a gap of about eight months between seasons. However, due to the pandemic and the strikes, the fourth season was delayed by four months and had only nine episodes instead of the usual 13.</p><p>Therefore, if Tacoma FD Season 5 faces similar challenges or complications, it might take longer to produce and air. However, if things go smoothly and production resumes soon after renewal, we might see Season 5 as early as <strong>July 2024 or as late as October 2024.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Tacoma-FD-Season-5-Cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If Tacoma FD returns for a fifth season, we can expect most of the main cast to reprise their roles as the quirky firefighters of Station 24.
