Over the past couple of months, we have seen various legends and new stars flex their lyrical prowess over other artists' beats. For example, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> put everyone up to the challenge to spit on top of the instrumentals for his For All The Dogs Scary Hours Edition. An EP was put out in late November of strictly the beats of the six additional tracks. A couple of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">rappers accepted the challenge</a>, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fabolous</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of New York's finest talents took Drake's comments to heart by <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">laying down bars </a>on top of "Evil Ways." Since that time, Fabolous has seemingly been inspired by that as he has begun his freestyle abilities to the test in a different way. Last week, Fab kickstarted a series where every Friday he would drop a new freestyle. "Benzgiving" was the first to hit the market and its racked up nearly one million views.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-tuluminati-by-fabolous>Listen To "Tuluminati" By Fabolous</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to HipHopDX, Fabolous recently took a trip to the small town of Tulum, which is located in southern Mexico. The hitmaker posted about his visit on Instagram, which turned out to be for a celebration of his birthday. It is where he also posted the music video for the freestyle, inspired by his stay. "Tuluminati" is on YouTube as well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new single and freestyle, "Tuluminati," by Fabolous? Is this the best song from this series he is doing so far, why or why not? Where do you rank him amongst the rest of the New York rappers of all time?
