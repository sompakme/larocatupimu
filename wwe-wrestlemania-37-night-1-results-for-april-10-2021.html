Match-by-match highlights and results from the show will take place on this very page. Feel free to leave any reactions in the comment section below.</p><p>Tonight is the first half of the biggest wrestling PPV of the year. WrestleMania is always an exciting show but this year’s is extra special because we will finally have a sizeable audience in attendance for the first time in over a year. And starting tonight’s show is the man everyone thought deserved his big moment in front of a crowd for carrying RAW for the past year, Drew McIntyre. Tonight McIntyre goes one-on-one with Bobby Lashley in an attempt to win back his WWE Championship.</p><p>Of course, the main event tonight will see Royal Rumble winner Bianca Belair take on SmackDown Women’s Champion, Sasha Banks. While this match has had a fairly basic build-up, online voices demanded the ladies be the main event and so here we are. Regardless of storyline, this match should deliver between the ropes but it will have a lot to do in order to outshine the others on the card.</p><p>Speaking of which, the rest of Night 1 consists of a steel cage match between Shane McMahon and Braun Strowman, Cesaro Vs. Seth Rollins in a singles match, The Miz & John Morrison Vs. Damian Priest and Bad Bunny, the RAW Tag Team Title match between The New Day and AJ Styles and Omos, and a Tag Team Turmoil match to determine the number one contenders for the Women’s Tag Team Titles tomorrow night.</p><p>And that’s the rundown for WrestleMania Night 1. We want to know which match you’re most looking forward to, as well as your hype levels heading into this massive event. So sound off below, hit that refresh button to follow along live, and enjoy the show!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kick-off-show>Kick-Off Show</h2><p>The WrestleMania Kick-Off Show is hosted by Kayla Braxton and she’s joined by Booker T, Jerry Lawler, JBL, and Peter Rosenberg. The fans in attendance chant for JBL and he encourages it. The panel joke around some before running down the card for tonight’s WrestleMania, which starts with Drew McIntyre Vs. Bobby Lashley for the WWE Championship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We get a video package for Bianca Belair Vs. Sasha Banks for the SmackDown Women’s Championship. They point out that Belair and Banks will become the first two women to main event a WrestleMania in a singles match. JBL says, just like Ron Simmons when he won the title, this has nothing to do with race or gender, these women have earned it. Rosenberg says there is immense pressure on both women for different reasons, and they say this match will prove who is the best of the best.</p><p>The panel discuss The New Day Vs. AJ Styles & Omos and Booker jokingly says New Day are not great, they’re just lucky. Lawler say’s he’s excited to see Omos’ debut and thinks he’ll live up to the hype. Kayla says the bigger they are the harder they fall and The King corrects her, “the harder they hit”. Booker likens Omos to Francis Ngannou in UFC and how he’s a giant who didn’t have all the ability but still rose to the top. JBL says Ngannou didn’t have to do it as part of a team.</p><p>A video package airs of the feud between Bad Bunny, Damian Priest, The Miz, and John Morrison. Booker says Bunny took the guitar shot to the back and he got back up, which says a lot about him. Rosenberg says Bunny is a monster in pop music and he’s been putting in the work to prepare for this match. JBL and Lawler say tonight is the night the music dies when Miz and Morrison teach Bunny a lesson. Booker says Bunny has been in fights and he loves WWE but JBL says he loves football but he can’t score a touchdown. The panel is split on this one.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Highlights are shown of the two Hall of Fame ceremonies from earlier this week. JBL shows-off his new ring after a year-long wait. JBL says it means so much to him as a kid who was a Hulkamaniac, and to go in the same night as Hogan did with the NWO was special.</p><p>The panel run down tomorrow night’s card, then talk about which match they’re most excited about tonight. The next match they talk about is Braun Strowman Vs. Shane McMahon inside a steel cage. They talk about whether or not Shane has bitten off more than he can chew. Lawler echoes Shane and calls Braun stupid, then JBL says he’ll never bet against a McMahon.</p><p>Sonya Deville joins the panel to discuss the Tag Team Turmoil match. Kayla asks her how she feels about the team of Mandy Rose and Dana Brooke and Sonya says she and Rose were obviously better because she was in the team. Deville says she will have her eyes on this match because of the huge ramifications it might have on the women’s division.</p><p>The panel run down the card one last time, then discuss the opening match, Drew McIntyre VS. Bobby Lashley. They quickly make their predictions for the match with JBL and Booker T siding with Lashley, and Lawler saying McIntyre will rise to the occasion. That’s it for the Kick-Off Show. WrestleMania Night 1 is starting right now, all you have to do is hit the refresh button below and sound-off in the comments!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wrestlemania>WrestleMania</h2><p>Night 1 of WrestleMania 37 gets underway in Raymond James Satdium with 25,000 and Vince McMahon standing on the stage with most of the roster. Vince says this past year the WWE Superstars performed tirelessly for the fans but there was something missing. The most important thing of all: the fans. After a terrible year, on behalf of the entire WWE family, Vince welcomes everyone to WrestleMania. Bebe Rhexa attempts ‘America The Beautiful’.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>As soon as the introduction video package airs, Michael Cole informs us that we’re suffering another weather delay and we’ll have to wait a little while. Earlier today there was a weather delay that saw the fans evacuate the stadium and some of the set get damaged. Hopefully this one doesn’t last too long but we already know the first match of the night and it’s a big one!</p><p>Sarah Schrieber is backstage with Shane McMahon and she asks how it feels to have the fans back. Shane says he had goosebumps and having the fans is the energy boost he needs to take-out Braun Strowman. Sarah says Shane has been bullying Braun and Shane says he hasn’t. He says he’s been using his brain, unlike Braun, and he has a few surprises in store for the cage match.</p><p>Bobby Lashley and MVP walk-up and interrupt Shane’s interview. MVP says the time for talking is done. This moment is to be the crowning of the All Mighty era. He says the only thing Drew McIntyre understands is violence and that’s the only language Lashley speaks. Drew wants the WWE Championship back but that isn’t happening. McIntyre appears and tells MVP to keep talking but MVP does his best to keep them apart. Drew says he’ll fight Lashley backstage if he has to, Mother Nature be damned.</p><p>Officials come to take Lashley away. Drew is asked where his head is at and he says he’s trying real hard to keep his emotions in check. A year ago he had his huge moment and he is so proud of everything he did but he’s got back to WrestleMania and a chance to win his title back but now the weather is trying to stop it. He doesn’t care what happens, he’s going to win that title regardless of where or how and it happens tonight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>New Day are interviewed backstage and Woods says they’ve been anticipating the return of fans for over a year but it feels so much better than they could ever have imagined. They’re asked why they agreed to fight Styles and Omos and Kofi says they love to take on all challengers and that’s why they’re the best. Woods says they’ve been fighting big guys since they both started wrestling and they can do it. They’ve beaten every team in the company. Big E randomly appears and Woods talks about how great he is and that he will retain tomorrow night. Big E says we’re gonna see why New Day are one of the greatest tag teams on Earth and we’re blessed to witness it.</p><p>Braun Strowman is interviewed backstage and he says he’s anxious to get out there and shut Shane McMahon up. He’s fighting for everyone who’s ever been bullied or made to feel stupid. Shane has backed him into a corner and he’s going to beat Shane to within an inch of his life.</p><p>Kevin Owens takes the microphone for himself backstage and recounts his history with Sami Zayn, going all the way back to 2002 and their matches in front of half a dozen in Quebec. They’ve been down this road a hundred times over twenty years, but he can guarantee no two men have ever been held down and told they’ll never make it as much as them. And now they get to do it once more on the WrestleMania stage. Sami Zayn is not the man he knew back then and tomorrow night he will Stun him, and if Logan Paul wants it he’ll be waiting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The EST. of WWE, Bianca Belair, is interviewed. Belair says she is not scared or nervous, she is prepared and ready for this. She says she lvoes and craves competition, so she can’t wait to get in there with Sasha Banks, then walk out as the Women’s Champion. But the best part of all is having the fans back and it’s amazing.</p><p>Next up for an interview is Seth Rollins. He laughs manically and says he loves the chaos of all this. Kevin Patrick asks him about Cesaro and Seth gets annoyed. Rollins says they can talk about anything but he had to bring up Cesaro and The Swing. Week after week Cesaro has been disrespecting him and he can only assume he’s trying to use his star power to springboard into the stratosphere. Rollins says the rain will eventaully leave, the stars will shine, and he will take care of Cesaro and put on one hell of a performance.</p><p>The weather warning has passed and fans return to the arena, so out comes the hosts of WrestleMania, Titus O’Neil and Hulk Hogan. Titus welcomes us to his city and says the WWE Universe has the energy we’ve been craving, weather be damned. Hogan says we’re going to make history tonight and tomorrow night, and we’re going to get started right now with the first match of the night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wwe-championship>WWE Championship</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-c-bobby-lashley-w-mvp-vs-drew-mcintyre>(C) Bobby Lashley W/MVP Vs.

Lashley shoves Drew in the face and they start trading back and forth until McIntyre forces him into the corner.</p><p>Lashley forearms Drew in the face but McIntyre clotheslines him over the top rope to the floor.

Drew passes out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-winner-bobby-lashley>Winner: Bobby Lashley</h2><p>The fans inside Raymond James Stadium seemed genuinely shocked at that result but that was a really good match regardless.</p><p>The NWO are backstage with Titus O’Neil when Bayley appears. Bayley tells them about her famous talk show and that she can have them on and it would be too sweet. Nobody will give Bayley the too sweet gesture and walk off on her.</p><p>Our next match is women’s Tag Team Turmoil. Two teams start the match, then more teams enter after a pinfall or submission until there is one team left and they get a title shot against Shayna Baszler and Nia Jax tomorrow night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tag-team-turmoil-match>Tag Team Turmoil Match</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-naomi-lana-vs-carmella-billie-kay>Naomi & Lana Vs.
