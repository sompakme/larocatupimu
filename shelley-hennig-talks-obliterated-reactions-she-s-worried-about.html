I just can’t wait for everyone to be able to watch it.” <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meghan-markle-1.jpg alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the Unveiling of the Labalaba Statue Meghan, Duchess of Sussex looking straight to camera on October 25, 2018 in Nadi, Fiji.

The group thinks they deactivated the bomb and go out on the town to celebrate. Hennig’s character, the serious, no-nonsense member of the crew, gets swept up in the action too.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I get obliterated, they all do,” Hennig describes. “And then I get a call from my boss and he says it was a fake nuke the real one is still out there. We’re all on something different and three sheets to the wind and we have to go save Las Vegas.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The show, which also stars Nick Zano, C. Thomas Howell, Paola Lázaro and Eugene Kim, is action packed, fast-paced and has many humorous moments. As Hennig describes, “It’s Top Gun meets The Hangover meets the show 24.” It’s also unflinchingly explicit. Hennig’s character has a hot and heavy sex scene with Zano in the very first episode. <a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/meghan-markle-1.jpg alt="Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex attend the Unveiling of the Labalaba Statue Meghan, Duchess of Sussex looking straight to camera on October 25, 2018 in Nadi, Fiji.

I’m not a prudish per person. I think anyone who follows me on Instagram understands that.” Hennig is, of course, referring to her often hilarious and provactive social media activity. “My parents are not on Instagram but they’re on Netflix. So I am feeling very vulnerable. But they’ve all been warned.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Filming the fast-paced scene took 10 hours, Hennig says, but the environment created on set through the presence of an intimacy coordinator, her close relationship with Zano, and the support of Hurwitz, Schlossberg and Heald made the long and intense shoot possible.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m personally very comfortable with nudity,” Hennig says, “It was safe space and and you couldn’t hold back.” It also helped that Hennig was in character as one of the show’s most fearless and daring team members. Winters is a quick-thinking, level-headed operative who we meet in the midst of her deeply suppressed grief over the death of her&nbsp;fiancé. Hennig relates to her deeply.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I can be a very focused person. I take my job really seriously and I put a lot of care into it. I have also used it, in the past, as an escape and Ava does that. She is heartbroken, she lost her fiancé and she’s throwing herself into her work to not have to feel that pain. And I’ve I’ve personally been there before.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This is what drew Hennig in but she was also excited by the chance to do something she’s never done before. “I like to be challenged. I like to do something I haven’t done before,” Hennig says. “The responsibility that Ava Winters had, and the responsibility that I would have if I booked it, I was ready for it and really excited by it. I had never done an action comedy, I’d done action and comedies but I’ve never done the mix. So that was a new genre for me and I love to genre hop.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The release of Hennig’s new show conveniently coincides with the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike and it’s clear that Hennig is excited to be back to talking about her projects and looking forward to the future — and is hopeful about an Obliterated season two.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m open. Let’s see what comes through. I’m pumped. I’m glad we sorted it out. I love to entertain so hopefully I get to be able to do that.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see all the nostalgic hits getting movie and TV reboots.</strong><br><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/best-nostalgic-reboots-1.jpg alt="Perry Mason" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamllg3p%2BlWiqoZ2cobK6eceepaehl2K8o7jIrZyrmaSasW66xK2dpaGoYr%2BmrcKtoKimo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
