"I was emotional, right?" the Unwine host explained in the video below when asked why she specifically brought up the Trinidadian's NDA now. "They don't like me going Live when I'm emotional, 'cuz I just get to talking," Tasha further admitted. "It's a blessing and a curse. If I'm angry, happy, or sad I gotta talk, and it was a lot of emotions going on."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tasha-k-gives-clarification-on-nicki-minaj-situation>Tasha K Gives Clarification on Nicki Minaj Situation</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Something just came over me to say it, but it wasn't...

"Me and Nicki have talked a lot over the years, and there's a lot of stuff that people don't know," Tasha alleged before painting a picture that displays Minaj as a victim. "I gave her stuff that she didn't even know what was going on," she added, proving her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">valuable role</a> in the blogging space.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Elsewhere in Tasha K news, it looks like the embattled blogger may have finally earned Cardi B's forgiveness for their defamation lawsuit despite still <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">owing the rap diva nearly $4M</a>.
