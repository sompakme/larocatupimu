The only SPF I knew as a kid was stark white, thick, impossible-to-blend, fairly gloopy, and came along with a distinct smell that could overpower any "Pine" or "Balsam and Cedar" car freshener. Now, you can pick up an SPF that applies invisibly to your skin or one that doesn't smell like anything&nbsp;at all.&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>You can brush it on</a>. You can spray it on. You can physically add it to other skincare products. But nothing proves just how much the sunscreen category has changed and advanced quite like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>SPF-infused eyeshadow</a>, one of Supergoop!'s latest inventions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the niche product sounds appealing, we can't help but wonder whether the world really needs an SPF-infused eyeshadow, and more specifically, SPF on our eyelids in the first place. To find out more, we asked a top dermatologist what he thought about sunscreen for eyelids. Keep reading to learn what he had to say.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-should-i-wear-sunscreen-on-my-eyelids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Should I Wear Sunscreen on My Eyelids?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It might not be as stressed as, say, applying SPF to your nose, but still, the answer is still... yes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The eyelids are one of the most commonly forgotten areas to be protected from the sun," notes board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Joshua Zeichner</a>. "Just like any other part of the face, the eyelids can develop a sunburn. Fortunately, when your eyes are open, the eyelids are not exposed to UV light as much as other parts of the face. However, if you have your eyes closed, and your eyelids are not protected, they can easily develop a sunburn. Plus, even with the eyes open, The exposed eyelid skin is still at risk."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-use-sunscreen-on-your-eyelids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Use Sunscreen on Your Eyelids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of today's skincare and makeup products are formulated with SPF (more on those, ahead) and can safely be used on your eyelids. "Eyeshadow with sunscreen in it can help protect eyelid skin," Dr. Zeichner tells us. "However, it should be used in combination with traditional sunscreen," he adds. "Similar to facial powder sunscreens, eyeshadows need to be applied in a thick enough layer to offer adequate protection."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can use traditional facial SPF on the lids, but Dr. Zeichner says to be very cautious that you do not get the SPF ingredients inside the eye itself. "If you have sensitive skin, stick to mineral-based sunscreens that contain ingredients like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>zinc oxide</a> by itself or in combination with titanium dioxide," he explains. "While sunscreens that contain chemical UV blockers are effective, they can be potentially irritating to the eyelids."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sunscreens-for-eyelids></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Sunscreens for Eyelids</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To keep eyelids and the surrounding eye area protected from the sun, invest in the right products.
