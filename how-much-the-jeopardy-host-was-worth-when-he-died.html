Contestants respond to prompts on the board in the form of a question, as they rack up hundreds of dollars â€” or even thousands. But how much did the star of the beloved game show earn along the way? According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, host <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a> was worth $75 million at the time of his death in November 2020.</p><p>That's quite a hefty paycheck, but after hosting the show for nearly four decades (he began in 1984), it is certainly well-deserved. Per&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, Trebek's annual salary was $18 million, which equals out to about&nbsp;$78,000 per episode. Because he typically shot five episodes a day, the outlet added that up to&nbsp;$391,000 of earnings per day of filming. Impressive, no?</p><p>However, it seems that for Trebek,&nbsp;Jeopardy&nbsp;was never&nbsp;really about the money. Sure, it began as a job, but turned into so much more. Per&nbsp;<a href=#>NPR</a>, Trebek said in July 2020, "I always felt that I had nothing particularly relevant to say to our viewers. I'm just a quiz show host who's been doing the same job for 36 years."&nbsp;But following his cancer diagnosis, he explained, "The outpouring from our viewers after I revealed my diagnosis... that caught me by surprise and that humbled me a great deal."</p><p>While <a href=#>many are in mourning right now</a>, Trebek's lasting TV legacy won't be forgotten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma29lZYNxe8ClnLFlpKeyo7HKrGSnnaRixLC%2B06FkoaenYrq2r8dmq6GdXZ%2BysLzAq5uyZZikwLV51pqqZq%2Bfp8GpedahnKdlmJp6pbXEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
