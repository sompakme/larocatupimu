It is hard to tell what is real and what is fake anymore. That is the exact sentiment us and a lot of fans are sharing right now pertaining to a viral photo of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Busta Rhymes</a> suggesting some serious <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">weight</a> gain. A X user (formerly Twitter) by the name of dirtywhiteups shared an alleged accurate side-by-side comparison of the legendary rapper just 20 days apart. To the left you can see a slimmer Busta in a white polo. Then, on the right, it shows the Brooklyn spitter donning a baby blue turtleneck sweater with a noticeable gut. In the caption, dirtywhiteups writes, "These two photos of Busta Rhymes are 20 days apart. Ozempic: 0 Oxtail: 1".</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Right now, fans are pretty much split in half as to whether or not this image is real. Some are in utter shock, while others feel the image on the right is from a few years ago or so. A few were also joking around saying that it is "probably gas". If you head over to Busta Rhymes' Instagram, he has some posts from just over a week ago. In them, he does not look nearly the same as this alleged recent photo.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-is-this-busta-rhymes-weight-gain-real>Is This Busta Rhymes Weight Gain Real?</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, just over a month ago, Busta shared some flicks from the sideline of the New York Knicks home playoff game against the Indiana Pacers. In those he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">looked incredibly slim</a>, and fans were quick to praise him for it. According to the Atlanta Black Star, Busta has not commented on his ever-changing weight gain/loss. However, like the tweet suggests, this could be a symptom of Ozempic withdrawal, which causes people to overeat and put on a substantial amount of weight if they are attempting to stop taking it. But Busta has not admitted to using Ozempic either, so we will not know unless he decides to clear things up.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Busta Rhymes' apparent weight gain?
