You need a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliners/>great eyeliner</a> that works just as hard as you do and can stand up against all of life's chaos. Enter: the best waterproof eyeliners.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re prone to watery eyes, have <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a21947411/viral-eyeliner-trick-for-hooded-eyelids/>hooded lids</a>, or touch your face too much (stop that), waterproof formulas are going to be your best bet. Felt tip markers and paintbrush liners are typically a go-to for sharp <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/makeup/g33013459/eyeliner-looks/>eyeliner looks,</a> but <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-liquid-eyeliners/>liquid eyeliners</a> can bleed if the right one isn’t used. And don’t even get us started on the disaster that is using an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliner-pencils/>eyeliner pencil</a> on the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-eyeliners-for-waterline/>waterline</a>, only to end up with accidental raccoon eyes. &nbsp;</p><p>To avoid these beauty disasters, you need an always-there, never-smear eyeliner, a.k.a. the picks on this list. The below list of editor- and makeup artist-approved waterproof liners, which boast various textures and price points, promise to outlast sweat, tears, oil, and humidity. And just to confirm: As with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/g3718/best-waterproof-mascara/>waterproof mascaras</a>, we're not talking about the waterproof formulas that suck the moisture from your lids and then require a sander to buff off. The picks on this list boast silky, easy-to-wear formulas and feel like normal eyeliner, except, well, better.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for-in-waterproof-eyeliner><span>What to Look For in Waterproof Eyeliner</span></h2><p>While it may seem obvious, the first thing you will want to look for when shopping for a waterproof eyeliner is the <strong>keyword "waterproof"</strong> on the product's packaging. Some products may claim they are "water-resistant," but "waterproof" means that liner really isn't going anywhere. <strong>"Long-wearing" or "long-lasting"</strong> are other keywords you should look out for.</p><p>Waterproof liners come in every formula, from pencil and gel to liquid, so you'll have to choose the right formula for you. Really, it all boils down to preference and skill level.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Pencil liners</strong> tend to be more user-friendly, since they're easier to hold.</li><li><strong>Liquid liners </strong>require a steady hand to get sharp, precise lines.</li><li>For pro makeup artist <a href=# data-url=https://modadatabase.com/stylist/danielle-parkes/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dani Parkes</a>, <a href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/best-gel-eyeliners/><strong>gel eyeliners</strong></a> are the way to go. "When I purchase waterproof liners, I look to buy gel pot eyeliners as I find those to be the easiest to apply," she says. "The formula of the gel is also best for creating and smudging the wing so it goes into the direction you want it to go in." &nbsp;</li></ul><p>You may also want to consider <strong>how a liner dries down or its "finish,"</strong> as this can have an effect on the desired outcome of your liner look. For example, pro makeup artist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=http://www.isabelyrosado.com/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Isabel Rosado</a> says, "Personally, I love a satin or matte texture finish in a liner. I am not a big fan of shiny or 'patent leather' finish." &nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-best-waterproof-eyeliners><span>Best Waterproof Eyeliners</span></h2><a href=# data-model-name="KVD Beauty Tattoo Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner" data-url=https://www.sephora.com/product/tattoo-liner-P245205 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Ftattoo-liner-P245205&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcYwXjJT5vpMRdJ9yjza4a-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">Best Overall Waterproof Eyeliner</span></p></a><p>KVD Beauty Tattoo Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner</p><p>Offered in black and brown, this liner gives "tattoo" an (almost) literal meaning.

No matter where I put it, it doesn't budge for hours. 24 hours on the lid and 12 on the waterline to be exact!
