The&nbsp;Brazilian model will appear in&nbsp;the magazine's upcoming issue, which will release July 21.</p><p>Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In honor of making history, Sampaio published an essay on Sports Illustrated's website thanking the publication as well as raising awareness for trans rights issues in her home country.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Brazil is a beautiful country, but it also hosts the highest number of violent crimes and murders against the trans community in the world — three times that of the US. Being trans usually means facing closed doors to peoples’ hearts and minds,” she wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“We face snickers, insults, fearful reactions and physical violations just for existing. Our options for growing up in a loving and accepting family, having a fruitful experience at school or finding dignified work are unimaginably limited and challenging. I recognize that I am one of the fortunate ones, and my intention is to honor that as best I can.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In 2019, Sampaio was hired as Victoria Secret's first transgender model. She's also worked with Marc Jacobs, Dior, and H&M, as well as appeared on the cover of Vogue Paris, Vogue Brasil, and Vogue Germany.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
