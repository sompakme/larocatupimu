This album is full of incredible songs and features. As it stands, the album is competing with the likes of Donda on the charts. Overall, it is believed that Drake will ultimately surpass Kanye, regardless of the quality of both of these albums. At the end of the day, Drizzy is the biggest artist in the entire world, and the Ye stands just have to deal with it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the standout songs on the album is "Way 2 Sexy" which contains a very recognizable sample. Overall, this is a song that could prove to be polarizing. It is a party anthem although some are already calling it cringe-worthy. That said, it is a song that Drake believes in as he already came through with a music video for it. Of course, the two featured artists, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Young Thug</a> can be found here. You will also see a cameo from none other than Kawhi Leonard.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-comes-through-with-a-certified-banger>Drake Comes Through With A Certified Banger</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This song is a ton of fun. From the sample to the chorus to the verses from each artist, this is a track made for the club. Future and Drake are always a winning combination, and that remains true on this cut. However, the addition of Young Thug is also a great touch. Overall, this is just a feel-good song and you can't help but bob your head to it. Sure, the sample is a bit jarring at first, but who cares?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know your thoughts on this new track, in the comments section down below.
