Appearing on the Rap Radar Podcast, Harlow detailed a recent run-in with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a> at the Met Gala. At the event, the two also posed for a photo together which made its way to social media afterward. Harlow says the Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers rapper was a big fan of his newest album, Jackman.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I ran into Kendrick at the Met,” he explained. “It was like a few days after the album dropped, and he was like, ‘Yo. Shit is incredible.’ And he gave me enough props that I could have just walked home. I didn’t even want to meet anyone else.” Lamar isn't the only artist to praise Harlow as of late. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ludacris</a> also recently co-signed the rapper while discussing his song, “First Class," with GQ, saying that it does "justice" to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fergie</a>'s 2007 track, “Glamorous,” which it samples.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jack-harlow-backstage-with-beyonce>Jack Harlow Backstage With Beyonce</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Beyonce has been on the road in support of her seventh studio album,&nbsp;Renaissance, throughout 2023.
