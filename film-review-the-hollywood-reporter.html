This Austin-set, modern-day variation of Miracle on 34th Street about a father who disdains Christmas features <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_willie-nelson data-tag=willie-nelson>Willie Nelson</a></strong> and <strong>Lyle Lovett</strong> singing holiday classics, as well as cameos by such music stars as <strong>Dale Watson</strong>, <strong>Sara Hickman</strong>, <strong>Marcia Ball</strong>, <strong>Charlie Sexton</strong>, <strong>Miss Lavelle White</strong> and Asleep at the Wheel’s <strong>Ray Benson</strong>. They deliver a refreshing musical Texan twang to this Hallmark Hall of Fame-style family movie that should enjoy a long life in ancillary after its brief, holiday-timed theatrical run.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Ho Ho Hollywood!

That this twinkly codger is named Nick and drives a bright red truck provides some not-so-subtle clues about his true identity.</p><p>But there’s a catch, as Michael soon learns to his dismay. The house is located on “Live Oak Lane’s Trail of Lights,” renowned for its lavish Christmas displays that were showcased on an <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> special. The curmudgeonly “real-life Grinch,” as he’s dubbed by a local news station, finds himself besieged by his neighbors—including Lovett, clad in a succession of garish sweaters—imploring him to put up the plethora of Christmas lights and decorations they bring to his door.</p><p>Whether or not Michael will come to terms with his past demons and learn to embrace the holiday is not exactly in much doubt, with the film shamelessly providing yet another tragic plot point to get him there. But there’s some fun to be had along the way, especially with Connick’s deadpan reactions to his colorfully eccentric new neighbors and their wildly garish decorations that even involve real camels and sheep.</p><p>It all goes down easily thanks to a terrific cast that also includes <strong>Kris Kristofferson</strong> and <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_fionnula-flanagan data-tag=fionnula-flanagan>Fionnula Flanagan</a></strong> as loving grandparents and such musical interludes as Nelson’s warbling “Silent Night” and “Amazing Grace” and Lovett and <strong>Kat Edmonson</strong> dueting on “Christmastime Is Here.” The end credits feature Connick and Nelson performing a worthy new holiday song, “When I’m Home.”</p><p><a href=#><strong>PHOTOS: Celebrities Celebrate Christmas: A Retrospective</strong></a></p><p>Director <strong>Tim McCanlies</strong> (Secondhand Lions) infuses the sentimental material with enough comic touches to prevent it from lapsing into sappiness, and the Austin environs locations, including the legendary Salt Pit barbecue restaurant, provides some nice regional flavor.</p><p>Opens Nov. 29 (Lionsgate)<br>Production: When EYA Productions<br>Cast: Harry Connick, Jr., Connie Brittion, Chandler Canterbury, Fionnula Flanagan, Lyle Lovett, Kris Kristofferson, Dana Wheeler-Nicholson<br>Director: Tim McCanlies<br>Screenwriter: Lou Berney<br>Producers: Elizabeth Avellan, Fred Miller, Shannon McIntosh<br>Executive producers: Scott Rankin, Sharon Rankin<br>Director of photography: Kamal Derkaoui<br>Editor: David Rosenblatt<br>Production designer: Christopher Stull<br>Costume designer: Karl Perkins<br>Composers: Carl Thiel, Scott Warren<br>Rated PG, 87 min.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2FjpqloJ2cqHq0tc2gZJ%2BhnKJ6s7HVopywZWZrfXGEkGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
