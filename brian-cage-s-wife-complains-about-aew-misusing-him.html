All you have to do is Google him and watch all his matches, [including] PWG. He’s a superstar and he’s being misused right now.”</p><p>Santos then posted a screenshot from a Q&A that a writer named Doug Maynard published on his website, where it was asked whether Brian Cage is being misused by AEW.</p><p>I’m just going to leave this right here. @AEW @AEWonTNT #briancage.</p><p>Is AEW misusing Brian Cage? He should be on a Brock Lesnar level ripping through talent with Taz being his mouthpiece.”</p><p>Cage responded to Santos’ tweet with the writer’s Q&A screenshot, stating that she didn’t write it and that she merely agreed with it.</p><p>Everyone who has an opinion on this (which you are rightfully allowed to do so)I just wanted to inform you all that Melissa didn’t write that statement about me being misused, she’s just posting and agreeing with it,”</p><p>It remains to be seen whether Brian Cage will be involved in more high profile matches and feuds in the future.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
