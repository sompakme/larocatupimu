The Memphis artist was the true definition of a mogul as he looked to remain independent while also bugging up other artists through his label. His lyrics were funny and charming, while also maintaining the authenticity of a man who has been through a lot over the span of his life. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">His passing still comes as a shock</a>, and it will take a while for his energy to ever be replicated again.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">His death was a particularly harsh blow to Key Glock</a>, who just so happens to be Dolph's cousin and protege. Dolph spent his whole life next to Dolph, and when he passed, Glock couldn't help but feel deep anguish, just as anyone in his situation would. The Instagram post below certainly speaks to the pain he's felt over the past couple of weeks.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To commemorate the life of his cousin, Glock decided to get himself a photo-realistic tattoo of Dolph, which he ended up placing on his forearm, as you can see down below. The tattoo is incredibly well done, and it does a great job at capturing Dolph's essence. These kinds of memorial tattoos are always cool to see, and it's a dope way for Key Glock to show love to his fallen family member.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of the new tattoo, in the comments section down below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/22/80/128022_3efd16f18b5bb0ff91b9da1860e39747.png><p><h6>Image via Key Glock</h6><br></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
