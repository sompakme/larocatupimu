Aside from popping up on his mom's shows when <a href=#>he and his sister, Cassidy, were young</a>, Cody also worked with Kathie Lee on Today as an intern when she hosted the fourth hour with <a href=#>Hoda Kotb</a>.</p><p>Not only was Cody an all-around helper (as interns are!), but he also co-hosted a segment called "<a href=#>Weekend Movie Preview</a>," where he gave his own recommendations and film critiques. However, Kathie Lee didn't always make the job easy for her son. "She keeps telling Jill [one of the other employees] that I have a crush on her," he joked during an <a href=#>interview</a> with Today about how his mom embarrasses him at work. " ... Just little stuff like that, it's never been detrimental to me." Gushing about Kathie Lee's influence, Cody added, "She's been very, very supportive of everything I do, whether it's sports, whether it's this, whether it's pursuing a career in film studies and ultimately hopefully directing one day, she's been great."</p><p>Today show executive producer Jim Bell defended the decision to hire Cody amid cries of nepotism, telling the <a href=#>New York Post</a>, "Is he getting an opportunity here? Yeah, but so be it. We like him and he's a smart kid and a good kid."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2ppaIFze9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5ypqroaGVYrmmsYygoJ%2Ben6extHnSqKVmm5%2BZxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
