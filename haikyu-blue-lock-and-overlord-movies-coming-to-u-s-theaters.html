It arrives both subtitled and dubbed on June 28 and kicks off with classmate Mikage Reo discovering Nagi Seishiro’s hidden talents and inspiring him to play soccer. One day, Nagi is invited to join the Blue Lock Project, where he meets the finest soccer players in the country. Shunsuke Ishikawa directs from an original story by Muneyuki Kaneshiro.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Crunchyroll also revealed it has acquired Overlord: The Sacred Kingdom, with a release date to be determined. It’s the first film in the franchise, and picks up after season four, with the story following a regular man transported into his favorite video game. Naoyuki Ito directs, from a story by Kugane Maruyama.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The moves come as anime has become an increasingly important genre in domestic theaters, which are looking for alternative programming amid a slowdown in studio films due to last year’s labor strikes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Anime is red hot right now,” said Mitchel Berger, senior vp global commerce as he offered a primer to the assembled theater owners, noting that for any western story they like, he could likely offer an anime they would also enjoy. He also noted that those who enjoy anime feel a strong (perhaps, obsessive) connection. “We don’t strive to be something to everyone. We want to be everything, to someone,” said Berger.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Crunchyroll, which Sony acquired in 2021, has found success in recent years, with 2022’s Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero grossing $38.1 million domestically and $86.5 million globally in 2022, and a year earlier finding it with Jujutsu Kaisen, which brought in $34.5 million domestically and $166.7 million globally. And the anime genre recently took home best-foreign-language Oscar for Studio Ghibli’s The Boy and the Heron.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Anime is made for the big screen, with its sweeping stories, dynamic animation, compelling characters, but also with the unique way it brings a passionate fanbase together,” said Berger, who boasted that Crunchryoll titles could fill a theater on any day, from a random Tuesday to an opening night Friday. “Fans tell their friends … about their experience, and then tell them very often,” said Berger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS%2B1KeaobGipLmtecGroKefmaO0bq3NoqSeZZ2kw6qx0mafmqGbrsJursuunGakn5i4bq3NnWSorpWnubC%2Bw2arqGWlYsBuwMeemK2doqh6cn6Sbm9vcWVtg3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
