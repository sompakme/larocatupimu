So, it only makes sense that, during a time when we're wondering how to feel warm and comfortable while also looking cute, this style icon would guide us yet again, wearing winter outfits that are worth copying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, many of her recent looks are from the set of her new Hulu comedy, Only Murders in the Building, so there was likely a lot of planning behind what she has on. Still, we can't deny the easiness and versatility of her character's bold, red onesie — err, jumpsuit — and will take it as a reminder that this piece is a good one to have on hand. Not only can it be dressed up or down, and clearly pairs well with lug-sole boots, we're also obsessed with how Gomez spiced it up with a green mask, aka a 2020/2021 take on the old <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>color blocking trick</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We also have a feeling that Gomez's character could be competing with The Undoing's Grace Fraser for the best on-screen coats. She wore two fuzzy, fluffy options while filming, and demonstrated how insanely cool it looks to coordinate your hat with your outerwear, stepping out in a muted-orange and yellow combination.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, one could argue that Gomez's best winter fashion trick was something all her own. Outside of her trailer, the actress and singer was seen wearing a comfy, cream-colored loungewear set, which perfectly matched the blanket she had in her hand.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As we wonder what to wear for our at-home holiday and New Year's Eve celebrations, this outfit does feel very 'end of 2020.' Gomez looks ready to cuddle up on the couch, but at the same time, the neutral color scheme comes across as elevated, and she's also wearing the year's ultimate comeback shoe, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Ugg boots</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Keo56mkWK0sLnEs2asnZyau6J5xqiknrJdpMK1ssitqmannqHGbrnUq5ueqqNitq9506GcZpqlnrmltc2g</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestW - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
